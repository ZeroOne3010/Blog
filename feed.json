If you haven&rsquo;t seen his performance, check it out here &ndash; you won&rsquo;t be disappointed:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now, Käärijä had a long career of several years already before the ESC, but he was a rather underground artist back then and I admit I hadn&rsquo;t heard of him either. After his performance in the contest I started listening to his earlier music as well and found some great stuff. Most of Käärijä&rsquo;s songs are about various aspects of partying, but what, I believe, makes him so popular is his attitude: he&rsquo;s never dissing anyone except maybe himself, and he&rsquo;s always happy to engage with his fans of all backgrounds. It&rsquo;s a bit shame that he doesn&rsquo;t have too many proper music videos, but here&rsquo;s a couple of my favorite pieces from him anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Välikuolema</em> (2022) is about having to lie down and take a break from partying. It&rsquo;s literally translated as &ldquo;intermediary death&rdquo;. Käärijä wants to party but he can&rsquo;t and needs a break.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>Auto jää</em> (2023) Käärijä made with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antti_Tuisku\">Antti Tuisku</a>, a very successful Finnish pop star who became famous in a talent show in 2003. The piece is about how your plans can change and you end up partying even though you thought you&rsquo;d drive straight home from work. &ldquo;Auto jää&rdquo; translates to &ldquo;the car stays&rdquo; or maybe more accurately &ldquo;drop the car&rdquo;, as you can&rsquo;t drink and drive.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAJ_(group)\">KAJ</a> finished fourth in the ESC this year (2025) and like Käärijä I hadn&rsquo;t heard of them before either. Their song was Bara Bada Bastu:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I looked into the group and it turns out they have been making hits for some ten years already! <em>Pa tu ta na kako</em> (2015) is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-pop\">J-pop</a> style song (they call it KAJ-pop!) about your grandma force-feeding you more and more cake. They have a brilliant music video and even a behind the scenes documentary (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qvylTVxbU7k\">part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g-uCBBvvfkw\">part 2</a>) about the video (in Swedish). After the video you might want to watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-rohYr7uqVs\">this live version with subtitles</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Another hit from KAJ is <em>Taco hej (me Gusta)</em> (2016). This one is about having a cozy night at home, making and eating tacos and tortillas. It&rsquo;s as catchy like <em>Pa tu ta na kako</em> and the music video is shot in a single long take somewhat in the spirit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Go\">OK Go</a>:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>Taco hej</em> also has a making-of documentary in Swedish (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iMS42foZlqM\">part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bh5Td-hFJ-Q\">part 2</a>), and you can also watch a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TPhB0pRz7b4\">live version with English subtitles</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So there you have it: it&rsquo;s worth looking into the Eurovision artists, you might discover some gems from their other songs.

The piece is about how your plans can change and you end up partying even though you thought you'd drive straight home from work. \"Auto jää\" translates to \"the car stays\" or maybe more accurately \"drop the car\", as you can't drink and drive. \n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/phFGtQETQTI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n<!--Käärijä has other great songs too, like [Paidaton riehuja](https://youtu.be/mxMNg9yEDL4) from 2020, [Mic Mac](https://youtu.be/3JI_adBJ9R0) 2019, and [Hirttää kiinni](https://youtu.be/OBtgo_Nzsiw) 2019, but in the interest of saving time I won't dive into them deeper, you're just going to have to listen to them. \n-->\n----\n\n[KAJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAJ_(group)) finished fourth in the ESC this year (2025) and like Käärijä I hadn't heard of them before either. Their song was Bara Bada Bastu:\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSh7U3m9KgA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\nI looked into the group and it turns out they have been making hits for some ten years already! _Pa tu ta na kako_ (2015) is a [J-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-pop) style song (they call it KAJ-pop!) about your grandma force-feeding you more and more cake. They have a brilliant music video and even a behind the scenes documentary ([part 1](https://youtu.be/qvylTVxbU7k), [part 2](https://youtu.be/g-uCBBvvfkw)) about the video (in Swedish). After the video you might want to watch [this live version with subtitles](https://youtu.be/-rohYr7uqVs). \n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FgCNV2yYOk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAnother hit from KAJ is _Taco hej (me Gusta)_ (2016). This one is about having a cozy night at home, making and eating tacos and tortillas. It's as catchy like _Pa tu ta na kako_ and the music video is shot in a single long take somewhat in the spirit of [OK Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Go):\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_J3ewiYdm6U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n_Taco hej_ also has a making-of documentary in Swedish ([part 1](https://youtu.be/iMS42foZlqM), [part 2](https://youtu.be/Bh5Td-hFJ-Q)), and you can also watch a [live version with English subtitles](https://youtu.be/TPhB0pRz7b4). \n\n----\n\nSo there you have it: it's worth looking into the Eurovision artists, you might discover some gems from their other songs. Leave a comment if you know of any other hits from any Eurovision artists, besides their ESC entry! \n",

I used to play it a lot some twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>The game may not look like much; in fact by default it consists only different characters and symbols of different colors: you are the <code>@</code> symbol, a grey <code>d</code> is your dog, a purple capital letter is some highly dangerous monster, a brown <code>%</code> is food, and so on. It takes a bit of imagination, but once you&rsquo;re fully immersed into the game, even looking at your own email address may send shivers down your spine because it looks like you&rsquo;re in a narrow corridor surrounded by monsters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The goal is to descend down a perilous dungeon, retrieve a powerful magical item called the Amulet of Yendor, come back up, get to the <a href=\"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Elemental_Planes\">Elemental Planes</a> and the <a href=\"https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Astral_Plane\">Astral Plane</a>, and finally offer said amulet to your deity, who will grant you the gift of immortality in return. This called <em>ascending the game</em>, i.e. ascending to demigod(dess)hood.</p>\n<p>So, how did NetHack get me playing the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(video_game_series)\">Battlefield</a></em> series, then? <em>Battlefield</em>  is a series of first-person shooter games that has always been bragging with some cutting-edge graphics, so it couldn&rsquo;t be much farther away from NetHack.</p>\n<p>Well, in 2010 <a href=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/2025/03/20/vivaldi-browser.html\">I was still using the Opera browser</a>. Opera had a strong community, and they hosted a community event where you could win a copy of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8tcEzayFio\">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a></em> by sharing your best gaming experience. Others shared experiences about games like <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>, or <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em>, and I, well, shared my first NetHack ascension &ndash; and was selected as one of the winners. One of the high points in my career as a gamer for sure!</p>\n<p>I looked up the relevant pages from The Internet Archive: the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100416034716/http://my.opera.com/community/blog/2010/03/04/win-a-free-copy-of-battlefield-bad-company-2?startidx=150\">contest pitch and my story is here</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100415221022/http://my.opera.com/community/blog/2010/03/08/battlefield-bad-company-2-winners\">the winners were announced here</a>. But just for the sake of completeness I&rsquo;ve copy-pasted my award-winning <a href=\"https://nethackmonsters.art/texts/yafap-celebratingtheordinaryintheextraordinaryworldofnethack/\">Yet Another First Ascension Post (YAFAP)</a> here. Enjoy!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My best gaming experience took place on 22. March 2004. That&rsquo;s the day I won a game of NetHack for the first time ever.</p>\n<p>I had been playing the same character, lawful dwarven female valkyrie, on and off for a month already. My previous valkyrie had also broken my previous record score but suffered the horrible fate of getting poisoned by the demon lord called Juiblex.</p>\n<p>This time I was more careful and even though I had met several new monsters and obstacles I had finally managed to get to the final level: the Astral Plane. The journey through the Planes of Earth, Air, Fire and Water had already been very difficult and exciting, but I remember well the adrenaline rush I got for finally stepping into the Astral Plane.\nThe Astral Plane contains three altars, only one of which matches your alignment. You must then find the correct one by trial and error and sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor to beat the game and to ascend to the demigodhood.</p>\n<p>So, typical for my luck, I had to visit the two wrong altars first. The Astral Plane is filled with incredibly powerful enemies, worst of whom are Famine, Pestilence and Death &ndash; three of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse &ndash; and they had already managed to kill me once or twice. I had had amulets of life saving but I was out of them now, so the next death would be, well, fatal.</p>\n<p>I remember my heart beating like crazy even though the game is turn based and all that actually was on the screen was letters and symbols of various colors.

				"content_text": "[NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack) is a notoriously difficult game that some people play for decades and never win, even if they have [all the spoilers](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) available. I used to play it a lot some twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe game may not look like much; in fact by default it consists only different characters and symbols of different colors: you are the `@` symbol, a grey `d` is your dog, a purple capital letter is some highly dangerous monster, a brown `%` is food, and so on. It takes a bit of imagination, but once you're fully immersed into the game, even looking at your own email address may send shivers down your spine because it looks like you're in a narrow corridor surrounded by monsters.<img src=\"uploads/2025/nethack.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" alt=\"A screenshot of NetHack, borrowed from Wikimedia Commons. Distributed under the NetHack General Public License. The image shows a typical in-game situation in a dungeon.\">\r\n\r\nThe goal is to descend down a perilous dungeon, retrieve a powerful magical item called the Amulet of Yendor, come back up, get to the [Elemental Planes](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Elemental_Planes) and the [Astral Plane](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Astral_Plane), and finally offer said amulet to your deity, who will grant you the gift of immortality in return. This called _ascending the game_, i.e. ascending to demigod(dess)hood.\r\n\r\nSo, how did NetHack get me playing the _[Battlefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(video_game_series))_ series, then? _Battlefield_  is a series of first-person shooter games that has always been bragging with some cutting-edge graphics, so it couldn't be much farther away from NetHack.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWell, in 2010 [I was still using the Opera browser](https://ville.saalo.moi/2025/03/20/vivaldi-browser.html). Opera had a strong community, and they hosted a community event where you could win a copy of _[Battlefield: Bad Company 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8tcEzayFio)_ by sharing your best gaming experience. Others shared experiences about games like _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, or _Medal of Honor: Allied Assault_, and I, well, shared my first NetHack ascension -- and was selected as one of the winners. One of the high points in my career as a gamer for sure! \r\n\r\nI looked up the relevant pages from The Internet Archive: the [contest pitch and my story is here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100416034716/http://my.opera.com/community/blog/2010/03/04/win-a-free-copy-of-battlefield-bad-company-2?startidx=150) and [the winners were announced here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100415221022/http://my.opera.com/community/blog/2010/03/08/battlefield-bad-company-2-winners). But just for the sake of completeness I've copy-pasted my award-winning [Yet Another First Ascension Post (YAFAP)](https://nethackmonsters.art/texts/yafap-celebratingtheordinaryintheextraordinaryworldofnethack/) here. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n> My best gaming experience took place on 22. March 2004. That's the day I won a game of NetHack for the first time ever.\r\n> \r\n> I had been playing the same character, lawful dwarven female valkyrie, on and off for a month already. My previous valkyrie had also broken my previous record score but suffered the horrible fate of getting poisoned by the demon lord called Juiblex.\r\n>\r\n> This time I was more careful and even though I had met several new monsters and obstacles I had finally managed to get to the final level: the Astral Plane. The journey through the Planes of Earth, Air, Fire and Water had already been very difficult and exciting, but I remember well the adrenaline rush I got for finally stepping into the Astral Plane.\r\n> The Astral Plane contains three altars, only one of which matches your alignment. You must then find the correct one by trial and error and sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor to beat the game and to ascend to the demigodhood.\r\n>\r\n> So, typical for my luck, I had to visit the two wrong altars first. The Astral Plane is filled with incredibly powerful enemies, worst of whom are Famine, Pestilence and Death -- three of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse -- and they had already managed to kill me once or twice. I had had amulets of life saving but I was out of them now, so the next death would be, well, fatal.\r\n> \r\n> I remember my heart beating like crazy even though the game is turn based and all that actually was on the screen was letters and symbols of various colors. In that state of mind I wasn't thinking clearly. When trying to make it to the final altar my characted got burnened by all the stuff in her inventory because of taking too much hit and because of the curses from all the monsters that were able to use magic. In NetHack it is really important not to get burdened because it directly affects your speed, so I got into even more trouble because all the monsters were moving twice as fast as I was.\r\n> \r\n> When my hitpoints were falling too quickly and the final altar was too far away I made my final decision: I dropped my bag of holding after salvaging a few of the most important items from inside it. This meant that I gave up on many weapons, scrolls, wands, potions and such that would normally help me stay alive but had now become just weight.\r\n> \r\n> After abandoning most of my gear I got my dexterity back and started fighting my final fight. The way to the altar was filled with monsters. The Horsemen were all right behind me, so I had to either lose them or endure their hits -- I couldn't lose any time fighting with anything behind me anymore.\r\n> \r\n> After quaffing all my remaining potions of healing and slaughtering lots of capital A's, @'s, D's and whatnots I finally made it to the altar. Just to be safe I looked at it, even though I knew the result beforehand: a lawful altar. There were still several monsters around me but I now knew that at this point they could not hurt me anymore: I was one turn away from ascending to the demigodhood. I checked my next commands twice or thrice: which keys to press and which item to sacrifice. After all, it would be pretty embarassing if not instantly fatal to try to sacrifice some junk item to Tyr when he was expecting the Amulet; not to mention the monsters around me waiting to land in more blows.

In my case I recently got myself a gym membership after some thirteen years away. (As a side note, it was weird to notice that all the weights had been recalibrated during the last decade! For example, a 10 kg dumbbell definitely wasn&rsquo;t that heavy the last time I tried!) At my gym are several Matrix exercise bikes, which have a fitness-test program. The program asks you to maintain a cadence (pedaling rate) of 60-80 RPM (revolutions per minute), and then it ramps up the level every two minutes, making it harder and harder to pedal. Once you can&rsquo;t sustain the 60-80 RPM cadence, the test ends.</p>\n<p>In my case I found that a leisurely pace is, for me, about 58 RPM, so already maintaining the required cadence took some conscious effort, even when the resistance was initially negligible. I got exhausted at around 14 minutes and 30 seconds, at which point the device displayed the final results: estimated VO₂max (maximum oxygen intake) of 46,7 ml/kg/min and then just &ldquo;245 Watts&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The VO₂max value is <em>good</em> or <em>very good</em> for a male in my age group according to different <a href=\"https://www.topendsports.com/testing/norms/vo2max.htm\">normative tables</a>, but I don&rsquo;t remember entering my weight into the device and I doubt it measured it either, so I&rsquo;m taking that with a grain of salt.

The MAP clearly isn&rsquo;t that interesting a figure, since you cannot maintain that kind of a power for any prolonged period at all, so what we&rsquo;re interested in instead is the <em>functional threshold power</em> (FTP), which reflects a rider&rsquo;s sustainable power output level. According to the online sources I found, a decent estimate of FTP is 0.75×MAP = 183.75 W. (Individual variation exists, though, so in practice the FTP is usually somewhere between 0.7×MAP and 0.8×MAP.)</p>\n<p>Fine, but how does <em>that</em> value compare, then? Alone, it doesn&rsquo;t really tell much so it needs to be scaled for the rider&rsquo;s weight, and in my case this power-to-weight ratio rounds to 2,0 W/kg. Most tables I found are for professional athletes, which I&rsquo;m not, but 2.0 W/kg is still good for an amateur. A club cyclist would have the ratio at around 3.0 to 4.0, and the very best of the best cyclists in the world have the ratio of some 7.0, which is just insane, translating to them riding steep uphills roughly as fast as I commute on flat ground.</p>\n<p>To double check the results by the Matrix bike I did the test again a week later and got the same results, so at least it&rsquo;s internally consistent. Next, I tried <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/cycling-wattage\">this online calculator</a>, plugged in the numbers from one of my regular commutes, and arrived at 2.1 W/kg, which is close enough to 2.0. (I use Strava to record my commutes, but only because it has an API. I find the free version of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stt.android\">Sports Tracker</a> a much better app and used that one for years, but they don&rsquo;t have an API, which I need, so what can you do.)</p>\n<p>So, what did we learn? The functional threshold power is a good way to measure the relative &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a rider, but calculating it without a proper cycling computer might not be entirely trivial. Also, for casual riders like me, the figure is basically useless anyway, unless I start to train regularly and in a determined way, at which point I&rsquo;m not exactly a casual rider anymore. There are also <a href=\"https://trainright.com/ftp-tests-how-to-perform-20-minute-8-minute-and-ramp-tests/\">several different methods of estimating the FTP</a>, such as the ramp test that I described, but also an 8-minute and 20-minute test.

I figured I'd now do the English-speaking world a service and translate a few jokes from this year's issue:\n\n > **What's a robot's favorite genre of music?**  \n> *Metal.*  \n> —Frida 1B\n\n> **Big brother told his little brother:**  \n> \"Look, a dead seagull.\"  \n> *Little brother looked at the sky, screaming: \"Where, where?!\"*  \n> —Lauri 4B\n\n> **What did a ghost say to another?**  \n> *\"Do you believe in humans?\"*  \n> —Anni & Erika 4C\n\n> **How do pandas get to a hospital?**  \n> *With a bamboolance.*  \n> —Lumi & Selja 3B\n\n> **Which birds fly higher than the tallest skyscraper in the world?**  \n> *All of them, because skyscrapers don't fly.*  \n> —Oliver 3A\n\n> **A teacher went to see a doctor.**  \n> \"When I push my index finger on my shoulder it hurts a lot. What's wrong with me?\"  \n> *The doctor replied: \"You have a broken index finger.\"*  \n> —Kristiina & Taimi 2B\n\n> **What's a snake's favorite subject at school?**  \n> *Hissstory.*  \n> —Luka 3A\n\n> **A snake asked another:**  \n> \"Are we poisonous?\"  \n> \"I don't know, why?\"  \n> *\"Because I just bit myself on the lip.\"*  \n> —Isabel 1A\n\n> **\"Doctor, my hearing has got really bad. I can't even hear my own farts anymore.\"**  \n> *The doctor writes a prescription.*  \n> \"Will my hearing improve with this medicine?\"  \n> *\"No, but your farts will become louder.\"*  \n> —Niilo 4C\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/1f13f2b1f3.jpg\" width=\"497\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Last week, April 16-20, my family and I did an Easter holiday trip to LEGOLAND in Billund, Denmark. The kids had never been on a plane and Denmark is not too far away from Finland, so it was an easy start, plus LEGO bricks are close to our hearts, so it was a good match of new experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-to-billund\">Getting to Billund</h2>\n<p>Our itinerary was such that first we flew from Helsinki to Copenhagen with Finnair. Their staff was very helpful already at the ground so we even got the baby pram onto the plane easily, a phase that I had been mildly nervous about beforehand. Even the security check went fine with me having the toddler in a front-carrier, although the 4yo was assigned to a random extra pat-down, which he bravely endured like he endures, say, a visit to the dentist.</p>\n<p>At the Copenhagen airport we had lunch at Burger King, for which we had reserved plenty of time before the next leg, which was a ~2.5 hour train trip to Vejle. (At this early stage of the season Finnair does not have direct flights to Billund.) There was a little hiccup with the train tickets and the pram, as it&rsquo;s free to take the pram into the ICL trains there but you still need to reserve a spot for them. For some reason the booking system did not do the reservation &ndash; I still don&rsquo;t know if I did something wrong or if the system malfunctioned &ndash; so I ended up having to call their phone service, where they were luckily able to add the pram spot reservation. The train itself, once we got there, was quiet and comfortable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250416-144442.jpg\" alt=\"Some buildings as seen from the train.\"></p>\n<p>At Vejle we had a quick transfer to a local bus 43. The ride took about 30 minutes and the bus dropped us right next to LEGOLAND and its hotels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-billund\">In Billund</h2>\n<h3 id=\"hotel-legoland\">Hotel LEGOLAND</h3>\n<p>We had reserved something called a Kingdom Room, themed after the LEGO Castle subtheme, so naturally we headed for the big hotel building that looked like a castle. It turned out, however, that that hotel was called LEGOLAND Castle Hotel, and our reservation was next door in Hotel LEGOLAND. Confusing.</p>\n<p>Hotel LEGOLAND looked from the outside like it was built in the 1970s, with the telltale floor tiles and a Functionalist-style porte-cochère. Indeed, checking from the Danish Wikipedia, it was established in 1968 as Esso Motor Hotel! The LEGO-themed hallways also seemed endless, but the slightly negative first impression turned better the next day after some rest and recovery.</p>\n<p>In the hotel the kids had little gifts waiting for them in the room, and even the baby got his first Duplo set of about five pieces. The room also had a box of random LEGO bricks to build with, however it was pretty cramped all in all so there wasn&rsquo;t a good space to build, especially if you wanted to shield your creations from your little brother.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lego-house\">LEGO House</h3>\n<p>The next day we headed for the LEGO House, &ldquo;Home of the Brick&rdquo; that was opened in 2017 a short 15-20 min walk away from the hotel. The LEGO House contains many activities, LEGO creations, building opportunities, a small library, some restaurants, a shop (with an underwhelming pick-a-brick section), and a floor about the history of the company and the bricks. You could easily spend an entire day there, and we basically did. We later overheard some other tourists talking during dinner about how they visited both the LEGO House and LEGOLAND during the same day, but that seems mental madness to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250417-111002.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the LEGO House.\"></p>\n<p>One highlight in the LEGO House is an actual brick moulding machine that constantly pushes out new 2x4 bricks. You can follow its working through transparent panels, and it even wraps the bricks in packaging. The 1yo found this device hilarious: he could&rsquo;ve watched all day when the freshly minted bags of bricks fell down the conveyor belt. 😁 Every guest was welcome to take one bag of six bricks as a souvenir and it was accompanied by a personal, unique instruction on what to build with them. See, six bricks 2x4 LEGO bricks of the same color can be connected in 915,103,765 different ways, and there&rsquo;s some algorithm that assigns each guest one of them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250425-204628.jpg\" alt=\"Six bricks connected in a way unique to just me.\"></p>\n<p>After the LEGO House we visited the roof of the building for a virtual geocache. The building even has activities on top of it in the form of various small playgrounds. The views could&rsquo;ve been nice on a sunny day, but that wasn&rsquo;t one of those days, so we quickly continued back to the hotel where the kids chased each other around a big castle-like jungle gym.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lalandia\">Lalandia</h3>\n<p>Next, we headed to Lalandia for dinner. Lalandia is a &ldquo;tropical holiday centre&rdquo; some ten minutes walk away from the LEGOLAND hotels, opposite direction of the LEGO House, and it&rsquo;s pretty crazy! When you enter it, it&rsquo;s like one of those movie magic moments when you go into a room that&rsquo;s bigger on the inside than on the outside. Outside, Lalandia looks like a large, boring grey cube, but on the inside there&rsquo;s a realistic (but fake) blue sky with white clouds, and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in some Mediterranean town all of a sudden. There are restaurants, a bowling alley, shops, and even a water park. Just wow!</p>\n<h3 id=\"legoland\">LEGOLAND</h3>\n<p>The next day was Friday, and that was the LEGOLAND day. Hotel LEGOLAND, it turns out, has a direct secret passage to LEGOLAND, but we walked across the street outside, only discovering the inside route later on our way back. Anyway, there were many people queuing into the park, but the line went really fast as people just got their pre-bought tickets scanned. No wristbands were issued either, unlike in the LEGO House.</p>\n<p>LEGOLAND starts with the Miniland: cities around the world built (mostly) in 1:20 scale. There&rsquo;s also the modest 36 meters tall LEGOTOP observation tower attraction, but when you look at Miniland from up there it&rsquo;s equivalent to looking at real buildings from the altitude of 720 meters! And when I said &ldquo;mostly&rdquo;, I mean to exclude for example the Burj Khalifa, which, if built to scale, would have needed to be some 40 meters tall, whereas now it&rsquo;s there as an &ldquo;only&rdquo; 5.5 meters tall LEGO structure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250418-102347.jpg\" alt=\"A part of the Miniland.\"></p>\n<p>As for the rides the 4 and 8 year olds found the blue &ldquo;high-speed merry-go-round&rdquo; Caterpillar the best. There was also a pirate ship shaped jungle gym that was a hit, and The Dragon roller-coaster, which had a bit longer queue. Next to the haunted house was a place to build your own monsters, I think the 4yo could&rsquo;ve spent his day over those bricks just fine too.</p>\n<p>Unbelievably, the restaurants weren&rsquo;t really family-friendly: you weren&rsquo;t allowed to take a pram into any of them, even the one called Family Buffet! This presented a problem as our little one was sleeping, but at least we were allowed to remove the carrycot and bring that one in. Then, of course, we had to make sure nobody tripped over it, so it wasn&rsquo;t an optimal solution either. Furthermore there was just one line to all the foods, and as everyone got hungry the same time, it was a long one, so you wanted to fill your plate to the max in just one go.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we survived the lunch experience. In the evening we had a three course dinner at the hotel restaurant, and that was a good one. As a bonus the restaurant, of course, had a LEGO building corner for kids, so we could dump the kids there for a while once they&rsquo;d eaten their buffet meals of LEGO brick shaped fries and whatnot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leaving-billund\">Leaving Billund</h2>\n<p>We had thought to leave Billund for Copenhagen the same way we came: by local bus and a train. It turned out, however, that the trains there don&rsquo;t really do weekends that well! We would&rsquo;ve needed to use a &ldquo;togbus&rdquo;, or train bus, i.e. a bus that replaces a train connection, and there would&rsquo;ve been more transfers. What finally killed this path for us was that a baby would&rsquo;ve needed their own safety seat in those buses! So, we just booked a 50 minute SAS flight from Billund to Copenhagen instead.</p>\n<p>The Billund airport is the second largest in Denmark, but still, as you might guess, pretty small. There&rsquo;s maybe four restaurants and you can see them all in the same place. We had some snacks and then had an uneventful ATR 72 flight.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250419-161723.jpg\" alt=\"Landing to Copenhagen.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"copenhagen\">Copenhagen</h2>\n<p>We arrived to the now-familiar Copenhagen airport at about 16:30 and after collecting our luggage headed for the trains, as we knew from Wednesday where they left from. The local trains weren&rsquo;t sticking to their schedule back then and they weren&rsquo;t doing it this time either, but the wait wasn&rsquo;t too long anyway, and the trip itself was something around ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Our hotel was called Good Morning City Copenhagen Star and it was basically right next to the central railway station. The room got a spontaneous &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; from the kids, being light and spacious compared to the dim and crammed, more traditional hotel room we had at Hotel LEGOLAND. Indeed, the room had the possibility to fit five adults and a baby crib without feeling tight! The staff was also super helpful and friendly and, when we asked for recommendations for &ldquo;anything but hamburgers&rdquo;, pointed us to a nearby restaurant called Frk. Barners Kælder that served local food. 😋 I had a huge Wiener Schnitzel and the kids had some stew and a part of my schnitzel, as I had a part of their minced beef steak too.</p>\n<p>The next morning we had a good breakfast at the hotel and headed to see the Nyhavn area, that we&rsquo;d also seen in Miniland the day before yesterday, by metro. The metro is fully automatic so that you can see directly into the tunnel from both ends of the train, and the kids found this fascinating. The 4yo especially appreciated the controls that were painted or sticker&rsquo;d into the table in front of the window and guided the train and its doors enthusiastically through the tunnels and stations. 🚇</p>\n<p>After Nyhavn we still had to make a visit to a LEGO store for some souvenirs &ndash; we hadn&rsquo;t picked up any sets from LEGOLAND or the Lego House. An open store was found at the entrance of the Tivoli amusement park, right outside of it. The store has two floors and is not too big, but it had Star Wars sets, and that&rsquo;s all we needed. My wife thought that 75383 Darth Maul&rsquo;s Sith Infiltrator would&rsquo;ve been cool, but the younger one counted the minifigures and set his sights to the 75372 Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack. The older one, however, saw a cool new Jedi character in 75378 BARC Speeder Escape, so as a compromise&hellip; we got them both.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250420-122346.jpg\" alt=\"A Danish guard in the LEGO store.\"></p>\n<p>After this it was time to get our bags from the hotel and head for the airport. As we had learned the local trains had troubles with their schedules, and the automatic metro was a more pleasant method of travel anyway, we took the metro instead. There was a transfer in the middle so we arrived to the airport a bit later than we&rsquo;d wanted, but still didn&rsquo;t need to rush.</p>\n<p>Once we had packed the pram again and dropped them and the other luggage off, the 4yo won <em>another</em> extra security scrutiny check. 😂 (Pro tip: if you&rsquo;ve bought a large bag to cover the pram in the plane cargo space, remove it from your luggage <em>before</em> dropping the luggage to be taken to the plane so that you have it when you start packing the pram.) Then we walked through the tax-free shop and spent our last krones to some sweets and cookies. (We actually had just a tiny amount of local money and used a card everywhere.)</p>\n<p>After all this the clock had advanced by a surprisingly large number of minutes, so we beelined to the other end of the airport for our gate. If the Billund airport had been small, the Copenhagen one is huge! It handles some 30 million passengers annually, roughly twice the number the Helsinki airport does. So the walk took some 15 minutes, after which we barely had time for a quick toilet break before the gate opened for boarding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Despite the minimal planning ahead of the trip (booking the Billund-Copenhagen flight was an embarrassingly last minute addition to the itinerary) the trip was a great success. The older kids will hopefully have something to reminisce for years &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s the fancy jungle gym at the hotel, or the Copenhagen metro. The little one, of course, won&rsquo;t remember a thing, but it was still heartwarming to see how happy he, too, was when he realized on Sunday evening that he was finally getting back to his very own bed at home. ♥️</p>",

The little one, of course, won't remember a thing, but it was still heartwarming to see how happy he, too, was when he realized on Sunday evening that he was finally getting back to his very own bed at home. ♥️\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I don&rsquo;t watch a lot of Finnish dramas, but 2025 will be written in history for me, as I&rsquo;ve already seen three great shows this year, which is about three more than I can remember from the decade before.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>First, there was <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27579939/\">Konflikti</a></em>, aired by MTV3. Technically it was late 2024, but I&rsquo;ll include it here anyway. In the series unmarked green men attack and take over the Hanko peninsula in the very southernmost point of mainland Finland. The show follows several different people or groups of people. A group of conscripts were practicing in the area when the incident started and are now trying to survive in the middle of an actual enemy; special forces are conducting a reconnaissance mission to the invaded area; the president and the prime minister have very different opinions on how to resolve the situation; and some more.</p>\n<p>The very first episode caught me by surprise with some professional military slang that was not explained &ndash; you just had to know or deduce it from the context. So the dialog is well written and the budget has been big for a Finnish show, with tanks, ships, and fighter jets zooming around. The show lasts for just six episodes, so there is not too much space for character development, but the characters are different and believable enough. 💥</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The next show I watched was <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33338105/\">Queen of Fucking Everything</a></em> by Yle. This show follows Linda, a middle-aged woman who is accustomed to a pretty wealthy life with his perfect husband. However, the man turns out to be a scammer, leaving Linda drowning in debt. Linda tries her very best to cover her misfortune and sudden loss of credit records from her coworkers — the kind of people who buy expensive coffees from baristas and then might just abandon them if a meeting comes up &ndash; which pisses Linda off, naturally, if it was her turn to buy those coffees with the money she just got from a pawn shop.</p>\n<p>The show gets increasingly unhinged in the best way. Eventually Linda, who turns out to be extremely resourceful but also very ruthless if need be, even gets involved with organized crime.</p>\n<p>When watching the show you never know where it&rsquo;s going. Sometimes it takes on some very dark tones, and sometimes the viewer can rightfully think that Linda is quite a bitch, but at the same time you still root for her, as she never asked to be dropped into a blender of social shame and financial ruin. 💸</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The last show I&rsquo;d like to highlight is <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29083876/\">Kurjen kirous</a></em> by Nelonen. In this one the main character is an actor named Aki Kurki (played by Kari Ketonen). Aki is stuck in forgettable mediocre supporting roles. He&rsquo;s convinced he&rsquo;s meant for greater things and can&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s never cast in anything significant. At one point he tells his manager Hannu (the great Antti Holma) that he doesn&rsquo;t want to do any &ldquo;crazy neighbors&rdquo; anymore, which is a fun nod towards Kari Ketonen&rsquo;s role as a crazy neighbor in another great show called <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6248306/\">Luottomies</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Aki is cast as a fortune teller in some show. The role is very small, but being the serious actor he is, he prepares diligently by booking an appointment with an actual fortune teller. The man offers to do a reading for Aki and finds out that Aki has a curse on him. Being a rationalist Aki walks out from the session &ndash; only to witness a smaller prediction by the fortune teller come true.</p>\n<p>This offers Aki an explanation for his stalled career: it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s had bad luck or anything, but he has been cursed! So, he embarks on a side quest to find out who cursed him, and whether that person could lift the curse, allowing his career to finally take off.</p>\n<p>Aki, like Linda in <em>Queen of Fucking Everything</em>, is a multi-faceted character: he is often arrogant and self-important, but at the same time he&rsquo;s trying to mend his relationship with his teenage daughter and to maintain other relationships too. And of course he takes acting very seriously &ndash; just not always the productions he&rsquo;s in if he doesn&rsquo;t think they have the artistic value he&rsquo;d deserve. 🎭</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So there you have it: three good Finnish TV shows that might some day even make it abroad as adaptations.

I've dubbed it _Saalo's Law of Software Development_ and it goes as follows:\n\n_**Every piece of enterprise software eventually evolves into either reading or writing Excel files.**_\n\nI originally posted this just to the company Slack where my peers unanimously agreed that yes, this is exactly what happens. There's something about spreadsheets that makes them the universal translator of the business world -- no matter how sophisticated your system, someone always needs that Excel import or export function.\n\nSo there you have my humble observation on how enterprise software works. My law may not be as well known (yet!) as [Hofstadter's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law), [Brooks'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law), or [Parkinson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) laws, but maybe one day. 😁\n",

I&rsquo;ve had successes with vibe coding so I was very optimistic.

Alas, it was not a great success.</p>\n<p>I started with ChatGPT 4o and described what I wanted to it: a simple ant colony simulator that runs in a browser, and where the ants leave pheromone trails and follow them. Emergent behavior from simple rules, like in the YouTube video I had watched. The system quickly blurted me out an HTML file with Javascript, and it was very promising. The simulation even launched successfully and ants began crawling around! You could even place down the nest, the food, and some walls, though the UI was clunky &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t even see the item you placed the simulation was running.</p>\n<p>I started to iterate the app with ChatGPT, giving it feedback on what works and what does not and got it improved a bit. Then, however, it seemed as if the system started to lose the context: features that had worked stopped working randomly on new iterations. I restarted the process a few times with new prompts and with the o3-mini-high model, but the results were similar. The AI either went for an overly complex model that didn&rsquo;t work, or left it too simple and added shortcut rules that broke the idea of emergent behavior from simple rules. For example, the AI thought that it would be great if an ant carrying food could head directly to the nest, no need to follow any pheromone trail. Needless to say, that isn&rsquo;t what I want.</p>\n<p>Next I tried with a local Qwen2.5-Coder, running on Ollama and <a href=\"https://www.openwebui.com/\">Open WebUI</a>. This seemed promising at first when Open WebUI even opened a browser frame next to the prompt as the model was coming up with the code. However, that approach didn&rsquo;t work at all when the model split the HTML and the Javascript to different files, and the UI wasn&rsquo;t made for such a complex setup. I might have retried with a refined prompt to ask it to output all the code into the same file, but I think it fell for one of the mistakes I had already seen ChatGPT make. Also I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to restart the preview frame if I lost it due to, say, refreshing the window, which was a let-down.</p>\n<p>Finally I tried the new Google AI Studio with the Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 model.

I adapted this approach from Zach Bart, founder of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics\">Zachtronics</a>, my favorite puzzle game studio. He mentioned in some interview that when he wants to make a new thematic game about, say, chemistry, he checks the teaching material about that subject available for some 10-15 year old kids, because that hits the sweet spot for what most people would find plausible enough but not overly complicated.</p>\n<p>Gemini provided me with the description, I asked a few clarifying questions, and off we went again. This time I made the additional request to use the <a href=\"https://p5js.org/\">p5.js</a> library, which is apparently very popular with these kind of apps requiring simple graphics. Unfortunately, Gemini&rsquo;s result was the only one that didn&rsquo;t do anything at all once run! I quickly debugged it having an invalid reference to the HTML element that was supposed to host the arena, though, and again the ants started crawling.

R2-D2 and C-3PO escape to Tatooine, are captured by Jawas and sold to Luke. R2-D2 shows message from Leia and goes looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi. Stormtroopers kill Luke's family.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the Oscars live broadcast close to twenty times now, and I&rsquo;d argue that&rsquo;s no mean feat, as they are aired here in Finland in the middle of the night. I also post my observations about the show to Facebook every year,  and several of my friends there have indicated, either offline or online, that they always look forward to my recap. Waking up in the middle of the night to watch the Oscars feels like madness already, but tradition is tradition! The best way to stay awake is to keep eating snacks. 🍿 The following is a summary of my live observations.</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s ceremony faced an unusual challenge, as the wildfires in Hollywood came dangerously close to disrupting the event. Host Conan O&rsquo;Brien even had to relocate to a hotel due to the fires.</p>\n<p>Conan was hosting for the first time, but he made the show his own right from the start. He had some sharp quips, like calling <em>Wicked</em> <em>“a movie for those who watched <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and wondered what college was like for the side characters”</em> and describing <em>Conclave</em> as <em>“a movie about the Catholic Church — but don’t worry.”</em> He also introduced a new concept: if someone’s speech ran too long, the cameras would cut to John Lithgow, looking extremely disappointed.</p>\n<p>One of the surprises came early in the night when Kieran Culkin won Best Supporting Actor for <em>A Real Pain</em>. In his speech, he reminded his wife of a promise she made a year ago: they could try for a fourth child if he won an Oscar — something she might not have expected to happen. 😄</p>\n<p>In animation, the underdog triumphed as the Latvian film <em>Flow</em> took home Best Animated Feature, breaking the usual Disney/Pixar dominance. Meanwhile, the Iranian short <em>In the Shadow of the Cypress</em>, a PTSD-themed animation, won Best Animated Short, with its creators only receiving their visas the day before the ceremony.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous years, the Costume Design category was given proper attention instead of being rushed through. It was revealed that the same designer from the original <em>Gladiator</em> worked on <em>Gladiator II</em>. The Oscar went to Paul Tazewell for <em>Wicked</em>, making him the first Black man to win in this category.</p>\n<p>Similarly, cinematographers were introduced with the same care. Lol Crawley won for <em>The Brutalist</em>, marking the film’s first win of the night. <em>The Brutalist</em> also picked up Best Actor (Adrien Brody) and Best Score, with Brody ignoring attempts to play him offstage.</p>\n<p>The first half of the show moved at a leisurely pace, even including a random Bond theme medley, but things sped up in the second half as winners were hurried offstage &ndash; although nobody got the ultimate punishment of getting the disappointed look from John Lithgow.</p>\n<p>Other notable wins included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best Adapted Screenplay: <em>Conclave</em>, written by Peter Straughan, who wore a Ukraine pin but otherwise, the ceremony remained largely apolitical.</li>\n<li>Best Makeup and Hairstyling: <em>The Substance</em>, a body horror film. Conan played into this by introducing himself in a clip where he crawled out of Demi Moore&rsquo;s body. 😈</li>\n<li>Best Supporting Actress: Zoe Saldaña for <em>Emilia Pérez</em>, whose speech included a complement about her husband&rsquo;s hair.</li>\n<li>Best Original Song: <em>El Mal</em> from <em>Emilia Pérez</em>, dashing Diane Warren&rsquo;s hopes for a win — her 16th nomination without a victory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the few winners I had actually seen, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, won for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. At one point, Conan even had the Dune sandworm playing the piano and harp, because why not? 😂</p>\n<p>The night&rsquo;s biggest winner was undoubtedly Sean Baker&rsquo;s <em>Anora</em>.

				"content_text": "I've watched the Oscars live broadcast close to twenty times now, and I'd argue that's no mean feat, as they are aired here in Finland in the middle of the night. I also post my observations about the show to Facebook every year,  and several of my friends there have indicated, either offline or online, that they always look forward to my recap. Waking up in the middle of the night to watch the Oscars feels like madness already, but tradition is tradition! The best way to stay awake is to keep eating snacks. 🍿 The following is a summary of my live observations.\n\nThis year's ceremony faced an unusual challenge, as the wildfires in Hollywood came dangerously close to disrupting the event. Host Conan O'Brien even had to relocate to a hotel due to the fires.\n\nConan was hosting for the first time, but he made the show his own right from the start. He had some sharp quips, like calling *Wicked* *“a movie for those who watched *The Wizard of Oz* and wondered what college was like for the side characters”* and describing *Conclave* as *“a movie about the Catholic Church — but don’t worry.”* He also introduced a new concept: if someone’s speech ran too long, the cameras would cut to John Lithgow, looking extremely disappointed.\n\nOne of the surprises came early in the night when Kieran Culkin won Best Supporting Actor for *A Real Pain*. In his speech, he reminded his wife of a promise she made a year ago: they could try for a fourth child if he won an Oscar — something she might not have expected to happen. 😄\n\nIn animation, the underdog triumphed as the Latvian film *Flow* took home Best Animated Feature, breaking the usual Disney/Pixar dominance. Meanwhile, the Iranian short *In the Shadow of the Cypress*, a PTSD-themed animation, won Best Animated Short, with its creators only receiving their visas the day before the ceremony.\n\nUnlike previous years, the Costume Design category was given proper attention instead of being rushed through. It was revealed that the same designer from the original *Gladiator* worked on *Gladiator II*. The Oscar went to Paul Tazewell for *Wicked*, making him the first Black man to win in this category.\n\nSimilarly, cinematographers were introduced with the same care. Lol Crawley won for *The Brutalist*, marking the film’s first win of the night. *The Brutalist* also picked up Best Actor (Adrien Brody) and Best Score, with Brody ignoring attempts to play him offstage.\n\nThe first half of the show moved at a leisurely pace, even including a random Bond theme medley, but things sped up in the second half as winners were hurried offstage -- although nobody got the ultimate punishment of getting the disappointed look from John Lithgow.\n\nOther notable wins included:\n\n- Best Adapted Screenplay: *Conclave*, written by Peter Straughan, who wore a Ukraine pin but otherwise, the ceremony remained largely apolitical.\n- Best Makeup and Hairstyling: *The Substance*, a body horror film. Conan played into this by introducing himself in a clip where he crawled out of Demi Moore's body. 😈\n- Best Supporting Actress: Zoe Saldaña for *Emilia Pérez*, whose speech included a complement about her husband's hair.\n- Best Original Song: *El Mal* from *Emilia Pérez*, dashing Diane Warren's hopes for a win — her 16th nomination without a victory.\n\nOne of the few winners I had actually seen, *Dune: Part Two*, won for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. At one point, Conan even had the Dune sandworm playing the piano and harp, because why not? 😂\n\nThe night's biggest winner was undoubtedly Sean Baker's *Anora*. It took home:\n\n- Best Original Screenplay (Sean Baker)\n- Best  (Sean Baker)\n- Best Director (Sean Baker) \n- Best Actress (Mikaela \"Mikey\" Madison)\n- Best Picture\n\nBaker dedicated his wins to the importance of cinema and gave a special shoutout to his mother, whose birthday was that day.\n\nThe In Memoriam segment honored legends like [Maggie Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Smith), [Donald Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland), and [James Earl Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones).
