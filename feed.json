It&rsquo;s an open-ended <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game\">programming game</a> where you use a programming language called Robot Scripting Language (RSL) to program battle bots to shoot at each other. The bots look like tanks, consisting of a tracked body, turret, and radar. The arena is viewed from top-down and, in addition to the robots, would also contain mines that you would want your robots to avoid, and cookies that give you more energy. The game relied heavily on its community, initially connected via the Robot Battle Mailing List (RBML), later via the Robot Battle Registry web forum.</p>\n<p>The Robot Scripting Language would allow you to program in a purely sequential way, checking various inputs one at a time and reacting to them, or in a more advanced event-driven manner. The game shipped with a few example robots and a manual that got you going. Once you were ready to test your bot, you would unleash it into the arena with others. At this point you became part of the audience, no longer able to affect the outcome. Usually you&rsquo;d also want your robot to play multiple games so that you could say with more confidence that your robot beats the other or others, say, 67% of the time.</p>\n<p>Robot Battle 1.4 was a significant update from 1.3.

The older version, however, needs an emulator.

In my case I recently got myself a gym membership after some thirteen years away. (As a side note, it was weird to notice that all the weights had been recalibrated during the last decade! For example, a 10 kg dumbbell definitely wasn&rsquo;t that heavy the last time I tried!) At my gym are several Matrix exercise bikes, which have a fitness-test program. The program asks you to maintain a cadence (pedaling rate) of 60-80 RPM (revolutions per minute), and then it ramps up the level every two minutes, making it harder and harder to pedal. Once you can&rsquo;t sustain the 60-80 RPM cadence, the test ends.</p>\n<p>In my case I found that a leisurely pace is, for me, about 58 RPM, so already maintaining the required cadence took some conscious effort, even when the resistance was initially negligible.

The MAP clearly isn&rsquo;t that interesting a figure, since you cannot maintain that kind of a power for any prolonged period at all, so what we&rsquo;re interested in instead is the <em>functional threshold power</em> (FTP), which reflects a rider&rsquo;s sustainable power output level. According to the online sources I found, a decent estimate of FTP is 0.75×MAP = 183.75 W. (Individual variation exists, though, so in practice the FTP is usually somewhere between 0.7×MAP and 0.8×MAP.)</p>\n<p>Fine, but how does <em>that</em> value compare, then? Alone, it doesn&rsquo;t really tell much so it needs to be scaled for the rider&rsquo;s weight, and in my case this power-to-weight ratio rounds to 2,0 W/kg. Most tables I found are for professional athletes, which I&rsquo;m not, but 2.0 W/kg is still good for an amateur. A club cyclist would have the ratio at around 3.0 to 4.0, and the very best of the best cyclists in the world have the ratio of some 7.0, which is just insane, translating to them riding steep uphills roughly as fast as I commute on flat ground.</p>\n<p>To double check the results by the Matrix bike I did the test again a week later and got the same results, so at least it&rsquo;s internally consistent.

The grand final of the show was held in Basel, Switzerland a week ago on Saturday, May 17. 🇦🇹 Austria won with JJ&rsquo;s song called <em>Wasted Love</em> (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/onOex2WXjbA\">watch it</a>), and in a sense this was a victory for Finland too, as the stage show of Austria was created and rehearsed in Finland (<a href=\"https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000011240310.html\">paywalled source</a>). 😄</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t care too much about the Austrian song, but at least it beat the 🇮🇱 Israeli one. Israel had orchestrated a huge advertising campaign for its song, essentially buying a huge number of votes for it, but it finished second (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/arts/music/eurovision-israel-votes.html\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>I do like the 🇪🇪 Estonian song that finished third: <em>Espresso Macchiato</em> by Tommy Cash (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9b9Z5HSCXOI\">watch it</a>).

				"content_text": "Early in May I [wrote](https://ville.saalo.moi/2025/03/09/esc.html) that Finland would have two entries in the Eurovision Song Contest this year, as the entry from Sweden was also performed by a Finnish band, KAJ. The grand final of the show was held in Basel, Switzerland a week ago on Saturday, May 17. 🇦🇹 Austria won with JJ's song called _Wasted Love_ ([watch it](https://youtu.be/onOex2WXjbA)), and in a sense this was a victory for Finland too, as the stage show of Austria was created and rehearsed in Finland ([paywalled source](https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000011240310.html)). 😄\n\nI don't care too much about the Austrian song, but at least it beat the 🇮🇱 Israeli one. Israel had orchestrated a huge advertising campaign for its song, essentially buying a huge number of votes for it, but it finished second ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/arts/music/eurovision-israel-votes.html)).\n\nI do like the 🇪🇪 Estonian song that finished third: _Espresso Macchiato_ by Tommy Cash ([watch it](https://youtu.be/9b9Z5HSCXOI)).

				"title": "Trip to LEGOLAND",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week, April 16-20, my family and I did an Easter holiday trip to LEGOLAND in Billund, Denmark. The kids had never been on a plane and Denmark is not too far away from Finland, so it was an easy start, plus LEGO bricks are close to our hearts, so it was a good match of new experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-to-billund\">Getting to Billund</h2>\n<p>Our itinerary was such that first we flew from Helsinki to Copenhagen with Finnair. Their staff was very helpful already at the ground so we even got the baby pram onto the plane easily, a phase that I had been mildly nervous about beforehand. Even the security check went fine with me having the toddler in a front-carrier, although the 4yo was assigned to a random extra pat-down, which he bravely endured like he endures, say, a visit to the dentist.</p>\n<p>At the Copenhagen airport we had lunch at Burger King, for which we had reserved plenty of time before the next leg, which was a ~2.5 hour train trip to Vejle. (At this early stage of the season Finnair does not have direct flights to Billund.) There was a little hiccup with the train tickets and the pram, as it&rsquo;s free to take the pram into the ICL trains there but you still need to reserve a spot for them. For some reason the booking system did not do the reservation &ndash; I still don&rsquo;t know if I did something wrong or if the system malfunctioned &ndash; so I ended up having to call their phone service, where they were luckily able to add the pram spot reservation. The train itself, once we got there, was quiet and comfortable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250416-144442.jpg\" alt=\"Some buildings as seen from the train.\"></p>\n<p>At Vejle we had a quick transfer to a local bus 43. The ride took about 30 minutes and the bus dropped us right next to LEGOLAND and its hotels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-billund\">In Billund</h2>\n<h3 id=\"hotel-legoland\">Hotel LEGOLAND</h3>\n<p>We had reserved something called a Kingdom Room, themed after the LEGO Castle subtheme, so naturally we headed for the big hotel building that looked like a castle. It turned out, however, that that hotel was called LEGOLAND Castle Hotel, and our reservation was next door in Hotel LEGOLAND. Confusing.</p>\n<p>Hotel LEGOLAND looked from the outside like it was built in the 1970s, with the telltale floor tiles and a Functionalist-style porte-cochère. Indeed, checking from the Danish Wikipedia, it was established in 1968 as Esso Motor Hotel! The LEGO-themed hallways also seemed endless, but the slightly negative first impression turned better the next day after some rest and recovery.</p>\n<p>In the hotel the kids had little gifts waiting for them in the room, and even the baby got his first Duplo set of about five pieces. The room also had a box of random LEGO bricks to build with, however it was pretty cramped all in all so there wasn&rsquo;t a good space to build, especially if you wanted to shield your creations from your little brother.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lego-house\">LEGO House</h3>\n<p>The next day we headed for the LEGO House, &ldquo;Home of the Brick&rdquo; that was opened in 2017 a short 15-20 min walk away from the hotel. The LEGO House contains many activities, LEGO creations, building opportunities, a small library, some restaurants, a shop (with an underwhelming pick-a-brick section), and a floor about the history of the company and the bricks. You could easily spend an entire day there, and we basically did. We later overheard some other tourists talking during dinner about how they visited both the LEGO House and LEGOLAND during the same day, but that seems mental madness to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250417-111002.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the LEGO House.\"></p>\n<p>One highlight in the LEGO House is an actual brick moulding machine that constantly pushes out new 2x4 bricks. You can follow its working through transparent panels, and it even wraps the bricks in packaging. The 1yo found this device hilarious: he could&rsquo;ve watched all day when the freshly minted bags of bricks fell down the conveyor belt. 😁 Every guest was welcome to take one bag of six bricks as a souvenir and it was accompanied by a personal, unique instruction on what to build with them. See, six bricks 2x4 LEGO bricks of the same color can be connected in 915,103,765 different ways, and there&rsquo;s some algorithm that assigns each guest one of them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250425-204628.jpg\" alt=\"Six bricks connected in a way unique to just me.\"></p>\n<p>After the LEGO House we visited the roof of the building for a virtual geocache. The building even has activities on top of it in the form of various small playgrounds. The views could&rsquo;ve been nice on a sunny day, but that wasn&rsquo;t one of those days, so we quickly continued back to the hotel where the kids chased each other around a big castle-like jungle gym.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lalandia\">Lalandia</h3>\n<p>Next, we headed to Lalandia for dinner. Lalandia is a &ldquo;tropical holiday centre&rdquo; some ten minutes walk away from the LEGOLAND hotels, opposite direction of the LEGO House, and it&rsquo;s pretty crazy! When you enter it, it&rsquo;s like one of those movie magic moments when you go into a room that&rsquo;s bigger on the inside than on the outside. Outside, Lalandia looks like a large, boring grey cube, but on the inside there&rsquo;s a realistic (but fake) blue sky with white clouds, and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in some Mediterranean town all of a sudden. There are restaurants, a bowling alley, shops, and even a water park. Just wow!</p>\n<h3 id=\"legoland\">LEGOLAND</h3>\n<p>The next day was Friday, and that was the LEGOLAND day. Hotel LEGOLAND, it turns out, has a direct secret passage to LEGOLAND, but we walked across the street outside, only discovering the inside route later on our way back. Anyway, there were many people queuing into the park, but the line went really fast as people just got their pre-bought tickets scanned. No wristbands were issued either, unlike in the LEGO House.</p>\n<p>LEGOLAND starts with the Miniland: cities around the world built (mostly) in 1:20 scale. There&rsquo;s also the modest 36 meters tall LEGOTOP observation tower attraction, but when you look at Miniland from up there it&rsquo;s equivalent to looking at real buildings from the altitude of 720 meters! And when I said &ldquo;mostly&rdquo;, I mean to exclude for example the Burj Khalifa, which, if built to scale, would have needed to be some 40 meters tall, whereas now it&rsquo;s there as an &ldquo;only&rdquo; 5.5 meters tall LEGO structure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250418-102347.jpg\" alt=\"A part of the Miniland.\"></p>\n<p>As for the rides the 4 and 8 year olds found the blue &ldquo;high-speed merry-go-round&rdquo; Caterpillar the best. There was also a pirate ship shaped jungle gym that was a hit, and The Dragon roller-coaster, which had a bit longer queue. Next to the haunted house was a place to build your own monsters, I think the 4yo could&rsquo;ve spent his day over those bricks just fine too.</p>\n<p>Unbelievably, the restaurants weren&rsquo;t really family-friendly: you weren&rsquo;t allowed to take a pram into any of them, even the one called Family Buffet! This presented a problem as our little one was sleeping, but at least we were allowed to remove the carrycot and bring that one in. Then, of course, we had to make sure nobody tripped over it, so it wasn&rsquo;t an optimal solution either. Furthermore there was just one line to all the foods, and as everyone got hungry the same time, it was a long one, so you wanted to fill your plate to the max in just one go.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we survived the lunch experience. In the evening we had a three course dinner at the hotel restaurant, and that was a good one. As a bonus the restaurant, of course, had a LEGO building corner for kids, so we could dump the kids there for a while once they&rsquo;d eaten their buffet meals of LEGO brick shaped fries and whatnot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leaving-billund\">Leaving Billund</h2>\n<p>We had thought to leave Billund for Copenhagen the same way we came: by local bus and a train. It turned out, however, that the trains there don&rsquo;t really do weekends that well! We would&rsquo;ve needed to use a &ldquo;togbus&rdquo;, or train bus, i.e. a bus that replaces a train connection, and there would&rsquo;ve been more transfers. What finally killed this path for us was that a baby would&rsquo;ve needed their own safety seat in those buses! So, we just booked a 50 minute SAS flight from Billund to Copenhagen instead.</p>\n<p>The Billund airport is the second largest in Denmark, but still, as you might guess, pretty small. There&rsquo;s maybe four restaurants and you can see them all in the same place. We had some snacks and then had an uneventful ATR 72 flight.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250419-161723.jpg\" alt=\"Landing to Copenhagen.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"copenhagen\">Copenhagen</h2>\n<p>We arrived to the now-familiar Copenhagen airport at about 16:30 and after collecting our luggage headed for the trains, as we knew from Wednesday where they left from. The local trains weren&rsquo;t sticking to their schedule back then and they weren&rsquo;t doing it this time either, but the wait wasn&rsquo;t too long anyway, and the trip itself was something around ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Our hotel was called Good Morning City Copenhagen Star and it was basically right next to the central railway station. The room got a spontaneous &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; from the kids, being light and spacious compared to the dim and crammed, more traditional hotel room we had at Hotel LEGOLAND. Indeed, the room had the possibility to fit five adults and a baby crib without feeling tight! The staff was also super helpful and friendly and, when we asked for recommendations for &ldquo;anything but hamburgers&rdquo;, pointed us to a nearby restaurant called Frk. Barners Kælder that served local food. 😋 I had a huge Wiener Schnitzel and the kids had some stew and a part of my schnitzel, as I had a part of their minced beef steak too.</p>\n<p>The next morning we had a good breakfast at the hotel and headed to see the Nyhavn area, that we&rsquo;d also seen in Miniland the day before yesterday, by metro. The metro is fully automatic so that you can see directly into the tunnel from both ends of the train, and the kids found this fascinating. The 4yo especially appreciated the controls that were painted or sticker&rsquo;d into the table in front of the window and guided the train and its doors enthusiastically through the tunnels and stations. 🚇</p>\n<p>After Nyhavn we still had to make a visit to a LEGO store for some souvenirs &ndash; we hadn&rsquo;t picked up any sets from LEGOLAND or the Lego House. An open store was found at the entrance of the Tivoli amusement park, right outside of it. The store has two floors and is not too big, but it had Star Wars sets, and that&rsquo;s all we needed. My wife thought that 75383 Darth Maul&rsquo;s Sith Infiltrator would&rsquo;ve been cool, but the younger one counted the minifigures and set his sights to the 75372 Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack.

				"content_text": "Last week, April 16-20, my family and I did an Easter holiday trip to LEGOLAND in Billund, Denmark. The kids had never been on a plane and Denmark is not too far away from Finland, so it was an easy start, plus LEGO bricks are close to our hearts, so it was a good match of new experiences.\n<!--more-->\n## Getting to Billund\n\nOur itinerary was such that first we flew from Helsinki to Copenhagen with Finnair. Their staff was very helpful already at the ground so we even got the baby pram onto the plane easily, a phase that I had been mildly nervous about beforehand. Even the security check went fine with me having the toddler in a front-carrier, although the 4yo was assigned to a random extra pat-down, which he bravely endured like he endures, say, a visit to the dentist. \n\nAt the Copenhagen airport we had lunch at Burger King, for which we had reserved plenty of time before the next leg, which was a ~2.5 hour train trip to Vejle. (At this early stage of the season Finnair does not have direct flights to Billund.) There was a little hiccup with the train tickets and the pram, as it's free to take the pram into the ICL trains there but you still need to reserve a spot for them. For some reason the booking system did not do the reservation -- I still don't know if I did something wrong or if the system malfunctioned -- so I ended up having to call their phone service, where they were luckily able to add the pram spot reservation. The train itself, once we got there, was quiet and comfortable.\n\n![Some buildings as seen from the train.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250416-144442.jpg)\n\nAt Vejle we had a quick transfer to a local bus 43. The ride took about 30 minutes and the bus dropped us right next to LEGOLAND and its hotels.\n\n## In Billund\n\n### Hotel LEGOLAND\n\nWe had reserved something called a Kingdom Room, themed after the LEGO Castle subtheme, so naturally we headed for the big hotel building that looked like a castle. It turned out, however, that that hotel was called LEGOLAND Castle Hotel, and our reservation was next door in Hotel LEGOLAND. Confusing.\n\nHotel LEGOLAND looked from the outside like it was built in the 1970s, with the telltale floor tiles and a Functionalist-style porte-cochère. Indeed, checking from the Danish Wikipedia, it was established in 1968 as Esso Motor Hotel! The LEGO-themed hallways also seemed endless, but the slightly negative first impression turned better the next day after some rest and recovery.\n\nIn the hotel the kids had little gifts waiting for them in the room, and even the baby got his first Duplo set of about five pieces. The room also had a box of random LEGO bricks to build with, however it was pretty cramped all in all so there wasn't a good space to build, especially if you wanted to shield your creations from your little brother.\n\n### LEGO House\n\nThe next day we headed for the LEGO House, \"Home of the Brick\" that was opened in 2017 a short 15-20 min walk away from the hotel. The LEGO House contains many activities, LEGO creations, building opportunities, a small library, some restaurants, a shop (with an underwhelming pick-a-brick section), and a floor about the history of the company and the bricks. You could easily spend an entire day there, and we basically did. We later overheard some other tourists talking during dinner about how they visited both the LEGO House and LEGOLAND during the same day, but that seems mental madness to me.\n\n![Inside the LEGO House.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250417-111002.jpg)\n\nOne highlight in the LEGO House is an actual brick moulding machine that constantly pushes out new 2x4 bricks. You can follow its working through transparent panels, and it even wraps the bricks in packaging. The 1yo found this device hilarious: he could've watched all day when the freshly minted bags of bricks fell down the conveyor belt. 😁 Every guest was welcome to take one bag of six bricks as a souvenir and it was accompanied by a personal, unique instruction on what to build with them. See, six bricks 2x4 LEGO bricks of the same color can be connected in 915,103,765 different ways, and there's some algorithm that assigns each guest one of them. \n\n![Six bricks connected in a way unique to just me.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250425-204628.jpg)\n\nAfter the LEGO House we visited the roof of the building for a virtual geocache. The building even has activities on top of it in the form of various small playgrounds. The views could've been nice on a sunny day, but that wasn't one of those days, so we quickly continued back to the hotel where the kids chased each other around a big castle-like jungle gym.\n\n### Lalandia\n\nNext, we headed to Lalandia for dinner. Lalandia is a \"tropical holiday centre\" some ten minutes walk away from the LEGOLAND hotels, opposite direction of the LEGO House, and it's pretty crazy! When you enter it, it's like one of those movie magic moments when you go into a room that's bigger on the inside than on the outside. Outside, Lalandia looks like a large, boring grey cube, but on the inside there's a realistic (but fake) blue sky with white clouds, and it's like you're in some Mediterranean town all of a sudden. There are restaurants, a bowling alley, shops, and even a water park. Just wow!\n\n### LEGOLAND\n\nThe next day was Friday, and that was the LEGOLAND day. Hotel LEGOLAND, it turns out, has a direct secret passage to LEGOLAND, but we walked across the street outside, only discovering the inside route later on our way back. Anyway, there were many people queuing into the park, but the line went really fast as people just got their pre-bought tickets scanned. No wristbands were issued either, unlike in the LEGO House.\n\nLEGOLAND starts with the Miniland: cities around the world built (mostly) in 1:20 scale. There's also the modest 36 meters tall LEGOTOP observation tower attraction, but when you look at Miniland from up there it's equivalent to looking at real buildings from the altitude of 720 meters! And when I said \"mostly\", I mean to exclude for example the Burj Khalifa, which, if built to scale, would have needed to be some 40 meters tall, whereas now it's there as an \"only\" 5.5 meters tall LEGO structure.\n\n![A part of the Miniland.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250418-102347.jpg)\n\nAs for the rides the 4 and 8 year olds found the blue \"high-speed merry-go-round\" Caterpillar the best. There was also a pirate ship shaped jungle gym that was a hit, and The Dragon roller-coaster, which had a bit longer queue. Next to the haunted house was a place to build your own monsters, I think the 4yo could've spent his day over those bricks just fine too.\n\nUnbelievably, the restaurants weren't really family-friendly: you weren't allowed to take a pram into any of them, even the one called Family Buffet! This presented a problem as our little one was sleeping, but at least we were allowed to remove the carrycot and bring that one in. Then, of course, we had to make sure nobody tripped over it, so it wasn't an optimal solution either. Furthermore there was just one line to all the foods, and as everyone got hungry the same time, it was a long one, so you wanted to fill your plate to the max in just one go.\n\nAnyway, we survived the lunch experience. In the evening we had a three course dinner at the hotel restaurant, and that was a good one. As a bonus the restaurant, of course, had a LEGO building corner for kids, so we could dump the kids there for a while once they'd eaten their buffet meals of LEGO brick shaped fries and whatnot.\n\n## Leaving Billund\n\nWe had thought to leave Billund for Copenhagen the same way we came: by local bus and a train. It turned out, however, that the trains there don't really do weekends that well! We would've needed to use a \"togbus\", or train bus, i.e. a bus that replaces a train connection, and there would've been more transfers. What finally killed this path for us was that a baby would've needed their own safety seat in those buses! So, we just booked a 50 minute SAS flight from Billund to Copenhagen instead.\n\nThe Billund airport is the second largest in Denmark, but still, as you might guess, pretty small. There's maybe four restaurants and you can see them all in the same place. We had some snacks and then had an uneventful ATR 72 flight.\n\n![Landing to Copenhagen.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250419-161723.jpg)\n\n## Copenhagen\n\nWe arrived to the now-familiar Copenhagen airport at about 16:30 and after collecting our luggage headed for the trains, as we knew from Wednesday where they left from. The local trains weren't sticking to their schedule back then and they weren't doing it this time either, but the wait wasn't too long anyway, and the trip itself was something around ten minutes.\n\nOur hotel was called Good Morning City Copenhagen Star and it was basically right next to the central railway station. The room got a spontaneous \"wow!\" from the kids, being light and spacious compared to the dim and crammed, more traditional hotel room we had at Hotel LEGOLAND. Indeed, the room had the possibility to fit five adults and a baby crib without feeling tight! The staff was also super helpful and friendly and, when we asked for recommendations for \"anything but hamburgers\", pointed us to a nearby restaurant called Frk. Barners Kælder that served local food. 😋 I had a huge Wiener Schnitzel and the kids had some stew and a part of my schnitzel, as I had a part of their minced beef steak too.\n\nThe next morning we had a good breakfast at the hotel and headed to see the Nyhavn area, that we'd also seen in Miniland the day before yesterday, by metro. The metro is fully automatic so that you can see directly into the tunnel from both ends of the train, and the kids found this fascinating. The 4yo especially appreciated the controls that were painted or sticker'd into the table in front of the window and guided the train and its doors enthusiastically through the tunnels and stations. 🚇\n\nAfter Nyhavn we still had to make a visit to a LEGO store for some souvenirs -- we hadn't picked up any sets from LEGOLAND or the Lego House. An open store was found at the entrance of the Tivoli amusement park, right outside of it. The store has two floors and is not too big, but it had Star Wars sets, and that's all we needed. My wife thought that 75383 Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator would've been cool, but the younger one counted the minifigures and set his sights to the 75372 Clone Trooper & Battle Droid Battle Pack. The older one, however, saw a cool new Jedi character in 75378 BARC Speeder Escape, so as a compromise... we got them both.\n\n![A Danish guard in the LEGO store.](https://ville.saalo.moi/uploads/2025/20250420-122346.jpg)\n\nAfter this it was time to get our bags from the hotel and head for the airport. As we had learned the local trains had troubles with their schedules, and the automatic metro was a more pleasant method of travel anyway, we took the metro instead. There was a transfer in the middle so we arrived to the airport a bit later than we'd wanted, but still didn't need to rush.\n\nOnce we had packed the pram again and dropped them and the other luggage off, the 4yo won _another_ extra security scrutiny check. 😂 (Pro tip: if you've bought a large bag to cover the pram in the plane cargo space, remove it from your luggage _before_ dropping the luggage to be taken to the plane so that you have it when you start packing the pram.) Then we walked through the tax-free shop and spent our last krones to some sweets and cookies. (We actually had just a tiny amount of local money and used a card everywhere.)\n\nAfter all this the clock had advanced by a surprisingly large number of minutes, so we beelined to the other end of the airport for our gate. If the Billund airport had been small, the Copenhagen one is huge! It handles some 30 million passengers annually, roughly twice the number the Helsinki airport does. So the walk took some 15 minutes, after which we barely had time for a quick toilet break before the gate opened for boarding. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the minimal planning ahead of the trip (booking the Billund-Copenhagen flight was an embarrassingly last minute addition to the itinerary) the trip was a great success. The older kids will hopefully have something to reminisce for years -- even if it's the fancy jungle gym at the hotel, or the Copenhagen metro. The little one, of course, won't remember a thing, but it was still heartwarming to see how happy he, too, was when he realized on Sunday evening that he was finally getting back to his very own bed at home. ♥️\n",

Just as you don&rsquo;t become a better photographer by buying a more expensive camera, you don&rsquo;t become a (better) programmer by using smarter tools. If you are prone to creating bugs without AI, then AI just enhances your ability to create those bugs faster.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it does not matter. If you&rsquo;re working on a hobby project for yourself and you&rsquo;re only running it locally, then it might as well have all the security holes in the world. However, the situation quickly changes if you deploy your application online and it has a backend to store any kind of a state.</p>\n<p>Also an important reason for this exercise to me, besides wanting to watch virtual ants, was simply to keep up with and assess the current state of AI code generation. We seem to be heading towards ever more advanced and omnipresent AI tools, so it&rsquo;s for the best if you start getting familiar with them already.</p>\n<p>So, how did it go? I&rsquo;ve had successes with vibe coding so I was very optimistic. I wish I could tell you it was a great success: that I gave ChatGPT one prompt and it gave me a working piece of code right away, and then I spent an hour watching my new virtual ant colony do its things. Alas, it was not a great success.</p>\n<p>I started with ChatGPT 4o and described what I wanted to it: a simple ant colony simulator that runs in a browser, and where the ants leave pheromone trails and follow them. Emergent behavior from simple rules, like in the YouTube video I had watched. The system quickly blurted me out an HTML file with Javascript, and it was very promising. The simulation even launched successfully and ants began crawling around! You could even place down the nest, the food, and some walls, though the UI was clunky &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t even see the item you placed the simulation was running.</p>\n<p>I started to iterate the app with ChatGPT, giving it feedback on what works and what does not and got it improved a bit. Then, however, it seemed as if the system started to lose the context: features that had worked stopped working randomly on new iterations. I restarted the process a few times with new prompts and with the o3-mini-high model, but the results were similar. The AI either went for an overly complex model that didn&rsquo;t work, or left it too simple and added shortcut rules that broke the idea of emergent behavior from simple rules. For example, the AI thought that it would be great if an ant carrying food could head directly to the nest, no need to follow any pheromone trail. Needless to say, that isn&rsquo;t what I want.</p>\n<p>Next I tried with a local Qwen2.5-Coder, running on Ollama and <a href=\"https://www.openwebui.com/\">Open WebUI</a>. This seemed promising at first when Open WebUI even opened a browser frame next to the prompt as the model was coming up with the code. However, that approach didn&rsquo;t work at all when the model split the HTML and the Javascript to different files, and the UI wasn&rsquo;t made for such a complex setup. I might have retried with a refined prompt to ask it to output all the code into the same file, but I think it fell for one of the mistakes I had already seen ChatGPT make. Also I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to restart the preview frame if I lost it due to, say, refreshing the window, which was a let-down.</p>\n<p>Finally I tried the new Google AI Studio with the Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 model. Previously I had tried to just give the models the task to create the app in one go, but now I had a different approach. I told the model I wanted it to make me an ant colony simulator, but not yet: we should plan it first.</p>\n<p>So, next I asked Gemini to explain me like I&rsquo;m five how ants in real life find food and then back to the nest. I adapted this approach from Zach Bart, founder of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics\">Zachtronics</a>, my favorite puzzle game studio. He mentioned in some interview that when he wants to make a new thematic game about, say, chemistry, he checks the teaching material about that subject available for some 10-15 year old kids, because that hits the sweet spot for what most people would find plausible enough but not overly complicated.</p>\n<p>Gemini provided me with the description, I asked a few clarifying questions, and off we went again. This time I made the additional request to use the <a href=\"https://p5js.org/\">p5.js</a> library, which is apparently very popular with these kind of apps requiring simple graphics. Unfortunately, Gemini&rsquo;s result was the only one that didn&rsquo;t do anything at all once run! I quickly debugged it having an invalid reference to the HTML element that was supposed to host the arena, though, and again the ants started crawling. But, long story short, Gemini made roughly the same mistakes that ChatGPT had made, like giving the ants a magical compass pointing to the nest, despite explicitly being told to have them follow the pheromone trails.</p>\n<p>In the end this was all about the journey, not the end result, so I don&rsquo;t mind not having my own ant colony simulator. Key takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&rsquo;s cumbersome when you need to copy-paste generated code around. The generation should be integrated directly into your actual development environment. You can even do all this with your phone only, but that is <em>very</em> cumbersome.</li>\n<li>If you try to avoid coding, you&rsquo;ll just end up debugging someone else&rsquo;s (the AI&rsquo;s) code. I, for one, usually prefer writing new code to debugging old one. And when the code is not made by yourself, you don&rsquo;t have a mental model of it, so debugging takes a lot of time.</li>\n<li>The technology is advancing fast. I have no doubt that some other model could&rsquo;ve successfully created a proper ant colony simulator already, or that the models I tried now will be able to do it in a year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&hellip;and indeed I hope to revisit this topic in the future.</p>",

I told the model I wanted it to make me an ant colony simulator, but not yet: we should plan it first.\n\nSo, next I asked Gemini to explain me like I'm five how ants in real life find food and then back to the nest. I adapted this approach from Zach Bart, founder of [Zachtronics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics), my favorite puzzle game studio. He mentioned in some interview that when he wants to make a new thematic game about, say, chemistry, he checks the teaching material about that subject available for some 10-15 year old kids, because that hits the sweet spot for what most people would find plausible enough but not overly complicated.\n\nGemini provided me with the description, I asked a few clarifying questions, and off we went again. This time I made the additional request to use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, which is apparently very popular with these kind of apps requiring simple graphics. Unfortunately, Gemini's result was the only one that didn't do anything at all once run! I quickly debugged it having an invalid reference to the HTML element that was supposed to host the arena, though, and again the ants started crawling. But, long story short, Gemini made roughly the same mistakes that ChatGPT had made, like giving the ants a magical compass pointing to the nest, despite explicitly being told to have them follow the pheromone trails.\n\nIn the end this was all about the journey, not the end result, so I don't mind not having my own ant colony simulator. Key takeaways:\n\n* It's cumbersome when you need to copy-paste generated code around. The generation should be integrated directly into your actual development environment. You can even do all this with your phone only, but that is _very_ cumbersome. \n* If you try to avoid coding, you'll just end up debugging someone else's (the AI's) code. I, for one, usually prefer writing new code to debugging old one. And when the code is not made by yourself, you don't have a mental model of it, so debugging takes a lot of time. \n* The technology is advancing fast. I have no doubt that some other model could've successfully created a proper ant colony simulator already, or that the models I tried now will be able to do it in a year. \n\n...and indeed I hope to revisit this topic in the future. \n",

Coffee doesn't even come with any warnings of the max recommended servings per day, unlike energy drinks. And this post doesn't even begin to address espresso, which is about four times as strong as regular coffee! \n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/a8b52dfe5e.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" alt=\"\">\n",

I got a new desktop PC in 2020 with an i7-10700K CPU that uses the then-brand-new LGA1200 socket, thinking that as it was brand new, it would have a long and happy life ahead of it and I could safely just upgrade the CPU in the future.\n\nWell, they used the socket for like two years only. Apparently the socket life spans have gone down dramatically from what they were earlier (like 20 years ago; see e.g. the LGA 775 socket), but Intel is especially bad in this respect, vs. AMD who has longer socket life spans. AMD released the AM4 socket in 2016 and the next socket, AM5, wasn't released until 2022.\n\nI didn't feel bad for Intel when the news broke the other day that their stock value is plummeting. My next PC won't feature an Intel CPU.\n",
