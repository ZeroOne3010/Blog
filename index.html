			 <p>About a week ago I was exploring other random blogs when I came across the <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2025/3/7-things-this-week-172">7 Things This Week [#172]</a> post by Jarrod Blundy. What caught my eye was the number on the title: Jarrod has been persistently listing seven things each week for more than three years already! In this day and age of single-click fire-and-forget retweets I find it admirable that someone can resist that urge to share the links immediately and do instead a little bit of curating, even adding a sentence or two of their own justifying why a particular link is interesting.</p>
<p>It surprised me too that literally just a random collection of links had this effect on me, so I dug deeper using Gemini&rsquo;s new Deep Research feature. (And this time I mean that <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Google AI</a>, not the <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/16/gemini-protocol.html">Gemini protocol</a>.) I must say Gemini is impressive: it formed a research plan according to my ramblings, then went away and crunched the internet for maybe ten minutes or so, and eventually returned with a convincing full report of the history of &ldquo;lists of things&rdquo; in print and online media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with all the details, but I learned, for example, that the <em>Time</em> magazine started a Potpourri column of random things already in 1923. For the online world, an early example of something similar is Dave Winer&rsquo;s DaveNet newsletter that started in 1994. I looked it up and found the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/about.html">DaveNet archive</a> &ndash; and oh boy isn&rsquo;t it a treasure trove if you&rsquo;re interested in the early world wide web! Dave covered, for example, the browser wars that <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/20/vivaldi-browser.html">I also recently referred to</a>, and the rise of the new and exciting programming language called Java. Dave wrote his newsletter for ten years and posted between one and a dozed emails each month, so check it out!</p>
<p>As for myself, I won&rsquo;t dare to commit to posting a regular list of things, but I&rsquo;ll keep the concept in mind and start now with a very short list. Specifically, it&rsquo;s a shout out to a couple of my favorite YouTubers and their most recent work.</p>

			 <p>I figured it would be an interesting little challenge to condense the plot of the original <em>Star Wars</em> into a very short format, but with as many spoilers as possible. I settled for a limit of one hundred words. Here goes; maybe you can use it as a refresher if you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie in a while, but quit reading now if you haven&rsquo;t seen it and want to watch and fully enjoy it later: üçø</p>
<hr>
<p>Vader intercepts Leia&rsquo;s ship seeking stolen Death Star plans. R2-D2 and C-3PO escape to Tatooine, are captured by Jawas and sold to Luke. R2-D2 shows message from Leia and goes looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi. Stormtroopers kill Luke&rsquo;s family. Luke joins Kenobi, meets Han and Chewie in Mos Eisley. They flee in Millennium Falcon but find Alderaan destroyed. Death Star captures Falcon. Kenobi shuts down the tractor beam while the others rescue Leia, visiting a trash compactor. Kenobi faces Vader, is struck down, becomes one with the Force. Falcon escapes, rebels mount an attack, Luke uses the Force, Death Star explodes.</p>

			 <p>Around the turn of the millennium the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a> were a thing. The first browser war saw Netscape Navigator unsuccessfully defend against the new Microsoft Internet Explorer. After a few years the remains of Netscape Navigator were forged into a new browser called Phoenix, soon renamed to Firebird, and finally to Firefox. I, however, stayed strongly in camp Opera during this time.</p>
<p>Opera was developed by a Norwegian company by the same name, and it was by far the most innovative browser of the time. They were the first ones to introduce tabs, a speed dial window, customizable shortcuts, quick search bar, and, my favorite, mouse gestures: to go back in the history, press and hold the right mouse button, swipe left, and release. Extremely simple and efficient, and there were gestures for all the other commands you could wish for, too. Opera also recognized the importance of a community and successfully ran the My Opera site for years.</p>
<p>My Opera was, unfortunately, shut down in 2014. Then, two years later in 2016, Opera was sold to China, and I stopped using it. In the same year, however, the former CEO of Opera Software released the first stable version of a new browser called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi_(web_browser)">Vivaldi</a>.</p>
<p>Vivaldi is to me the spiritual successor of Opera. You get the familiar full customizability and a bunch of features out of the box that other browsers can only have as plugins, if even that. Notoriously, Google recently basically removed the extremely popular uBlock Origin ad blocker from their plugin store, obviously because showing ads to you is their primary business. üò¨ Other than ad blocking and tracker blocking, Vivaldi has, for example, a feed reader, tiling &amp; stacking of tabs, the aforementioned mouse gestures, themes, and much more.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about the <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/18/kagi-search.html">Kagi Search</a>, to which someone who read it could&rsquo;ve wondered if I use the Chrome browser anyway, in which case my privacy wouldn&rsquo;t be any more protected with Kagi than it is with Google. I do need Chrome for work, but at home I use Vivaldi and haven&rsquo;t signed in to my Google account with it. I&rsquo;m under no illusion that Google wouldn&rsquo;t still be able to track me, but at least I don&rsquo;t need to make it trivial to them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a browser that puts you in control, Vivaldi is worth a try. Get it from <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">vivaldi.com</a> to give it a spin!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>About three months ago I ditched Google as my primary search engine and started using <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> instead &ndash; and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<p>Kagi is a subscription based service: you get to test it for free for one hundred searches, and if you are satisfied, you can start with the 5 USD/month (+tax) plan that includes 300 searches. I&rsquo;ve found that with my usage I can usually manage about 27 days, after which I can just renew the monthly subscription a bit early with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>Why pay for your search engine, then, when Google is free? Well, the old saying goes that if you&rsquo;re not paying for the product, then you are the product. In practice this means that you will be shown lots of ads and &ldquo;sponsored links&rdquo; &ndash; which are just ads by another name. It seems that companies often buy ads that target their competitors too, so if you&rsquo;re looking for info about product X of company Y, then the first &ldquo;search results&rdquo; you get are actually about the competing product Z by company W. All this gets quite tiring in the long run. I also noticed that not only because of this but because of ChatGPT my Google searches had dropped dramatically. Google just didn&rsquo;t have any pull anymore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Kagi doing better, then? For one, they don&rsquo;t have ads, so they are not incentivized to serve any advertisers but you, the user. For a user there are some neat features, such as increasing or decreasing the priority of any sites in your search results, something that I have indeed missed in Google. Kagi also has a delightful <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Small Web initiative</a> highlighting little personal sites that you couldn&rsquo;t find with Google even by accident. Kagi also has an actual <a href="https://kagi.com/changelog">changelog</a> &ndash; when have you ever seen a search engine, or any major web site for that, display one proudly? These little details make Kagi feel like it&rsquo;s made by humans for humans. <a href="https://dkb.io/post/DEPR_kagi-interview">Kagi&rsquo;s origin story</a> is also worth reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s a growing sense that people are tired of being the product and of the general enshittification of the web. People want control over their own their data, they don&rsquo;t want Meta, Google, or that dumpster fire X deciding what they may access and see. You constantly get to read about people and businesses that are locked out of their Instagram accounts for no apparent reason and there&rsquo;s nothing they can do to appeal because it&rsquo;s all handled by some faceless algorithms. That&rsquo;s a contributing factor also to why I&rsquo;m using the Micro.blog platform for hosting this blog and why I&rsquo;m using Kagi: I want to support the smaller players that are still trying to Do The Right Thing.</p>

		<a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/16/caffeine.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-16 22:26:32 &#43;0200">Mar 16, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There is a common misconception that energy drinks have a particularly high caffeine concentration. Often the people who fuss over this are coffee drinkers themselves.</p>
<p>Energy drinks typically have 32 mg of caffeine per 100 ml. This translates to the following total amounts of caffeine per container:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Container Size</th>
<th>Caffeine (mg)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.25 L</td>
<td>80 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.33 L</td>
<td>106 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.5 L</td>
<td>160 mg</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, coffee on the other hand has about 44,8 - 80 mg of caffeine per 100 ml, translating to the following dozages:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Container Size</th>
<th>Caffeine (mg) (Range)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.125 L (small cup)</td>
<td>56 - 100 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.2 L (medium mug)</td>
<td>90 - 160 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.25 L (large mug)</td>
<td>112 - 250 mg</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(<a href="https://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/dlk01123">Source</a>)</p>
<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s the same as an image &ndash; I hope that by now you&rsquo;ll agree that if you want to be worried about someone getting too much caffeine, you should be worried of those who drink coffee. Coffee doesn&rsquo;t even come with any warnings of the max recommended servings per day, unlike energy drinks. And this post doesn&rsquo;t even begin to address espresso, which is about four times as strong as regular coffee!</p>

			 <p>The other day I was browsing some random Micro.blog blogs when I came across an <a href="https://heyloura.com/2025/03/11/coding-adventure-using-deno-and.html">interesting post about Gemini in the Hey Loura! blog</a>. Gemini in this case does not refer to Google&rsquo;s AI service but an application layer internet protocol developed quite recently, in 2019.</p>
<p>Gemini is kind of like HTTP but very, very simple. Gemini&rsquo;s preferred document format is gemtext, which is almost a subset of Markdown: you get headers and lists (but no nested lists) and hyperlinks (that need to be on their own line). You also get quotes and preformatted text for presenting code, but that&rsquo;s it. It does not support, for example, styles or inline images.</p>
<p>No normal browser supports Gemini. The &ldquo;Geminispace&rdquo; can, however, be accessed by a number of custom browsers that can use the <code>gemini://</code> protocol. Anyone can host a Gemini &ldquo;capsule&rdquo; by themself, or use one of the free or paid services to do that.</p>
<p>Somehow I find the idea behind Gemini quite appealing: no ads; no big companies trying to hook you or exploit you; no competing for likes or subscriptions; quick loading times; pages where the content speaks for itself. Even the mobile versions of many web sites are rather heavy these days, which can be observed if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to use the internet while traveling in a plane, but Gemini pages promise to be even more light-weight.</p>
<p>Learn more from the project&rsquo;s web site at <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">GeminiProtocol.net</a> or from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve watched the Oscars live broadcast close to twenty times now, and I&rsquo;d argue that&rsquo;s no mean feat, as they are aired here in Finland in the middle of the night. I also post my observations about the show to Facebook every year,  and several of my friends there have indicated, either offline or online, that they always look forward to my recap. Waking up in the middle of the night to watch the Oscars feels like madness already, but tradition is tradition! The best way to stay awake is to keep eating snacks. üçø The following is a summary of my live observations.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s ceremony faced an unusual challenge, as the wildfires in Hollywood came dangerously close to disrupting the event. Host Conan O&rsquo;Brien even had to relocate to a hotel due to the fires.</p>
<p>Conan was hosting for the first time, but he made the show his own right from the start. He had some sharp quips, like calling <em>Wicked</em> <em>‚Äúa movie for those who watched <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and wondered what college was like for the side characters‚Äù</em> and describing <em>Conclave</em> as <em>‚Äúa movie about the Catholic Church ‚Äî but don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù</em> He also introduced a new concept: if someone‚Äôs speech ran too long, the cameras would cut to John Lithgow, looking extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>One of the surprises came early in the night when Kieran Culkin won Best Supporting Actor for <em>A Real Pain</em>. In his speech, he reminded his wife of a promise she made a year ago: they could try for a fourth child if he won an Oscar ‚Äî something she might not have expected to happen. üòÑ</p>
<p>In animation, the underdog triumphed as the Latvian film <em>Flow</em> took home Best Animated Feature, breaking the usual Disney/Pixar dominance. Meanwhile, the Iranian short <em>In the Shadow of the Cypress</em>, a PTSD-themed animation, won Best Animated Short, with its creators only receiving their visas the day before the ceremony.</p>
<p>Unlike previous years, the Costume Design category was given proper attention instead of being rushed through. It was revealed that the same designer from the original <em>Gladiator</em> worked on <em>Gladiator II</em>. The Oscar went to Paul Tazewell for <em>Wicked</em>, making him the first Black man to win in this category.</p>
<p>Similarly, cinematographers were introduced with the same care. Lol Crawley won for <em>The Brutalist</em>, marking the film‚Äôs first win of the night. <em>The Brutalist</em> also picked up Best Actor (Adrien Brody) and Best Score, with Brody ignoring attempts to play him offstage.</p>
<p>The first half of the show moved at a leisurely pace, even including a random Bond theme medley, but things sped up in the second half as winners were hurried offstage &ndash; although nobody got the ultimate punishment of getting the disappointed look from John Lithgow.</p>
<p>Other notable wins included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Adapted Screenplay: <em>Conclave</em>, written by Peter Straughan, who wore a Ukraine pin but otherwise, the ceremony remained largely apolitical.</li>
<li>Best Makeup and Hairstyling: <em>The Substance</em>, a body horror film. Conan played into this by introducing himself in a clip where he crawled out of Demi Moore&rsquo;s body. üòà</li>
<li>Best Supporting Actress: Zoe Salda√±a for <em>Emilia P√©rez</em>, whose speech included a complement about her husband&rsquo;s hair.</li>
<li>Best Original Song: <em>El Mal</em> from <em>Emilia P√©rez</em>, dashing Diane Warren&rsquo;s hopes for a win ‚Äî her 16th nomination without a victory.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the few winners I had actually seen, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, won for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. At one point, Conan even had the Dune sandworm playing the piano and harp, because why not? üòÇ</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s biggest winner was undoubtedly Sean Baker&rsquo;s <em>Anora</em>. It took home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Original Screenplay (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best  (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best Director (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best Actress (Mikaela &ldquo;Mikey&rdquo; Madison)</li>
<li>Best Picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Baker dedicated his wins to the importance of cinema and gave a special shoutout to his mother, whose birthday was that day.</p>
<p>The In Memoriam segment honored legends like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Smith">Maggie Smith</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">James Earl Jones</a>. The ceremony finally wrapped up an hour later than last year at about 05:45, well before the sunrise at 07:12.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think about what your average citizen of today should know about the demoscene, the least would be the fact that such a long line of digital culture exists. Even if it&rsquo;s quite hidden from the mainstream, it has given rise to a huge amount of talent. Another is the existence of such media art and a community, of which not much is known, but which has been very active and played a significant part for those involved. Rather than thinking of whatever useful business skills were acquired, I would like the latter point to be the takeaway from all this.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell_(company)">Supercell</a> is a pretty successful Finnish mobile game company. I have been enjoying Clash Royale in particular. It&rsquo;s a real time game where you have a deck of cards that can bring units to the battle arena, and with them you try to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s King Tower. Cards are played with elixir that regenerates all the time, more or less slowly, depending on the game mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like rock-paper-scissors: for example, P.E.K.K.A is a huge, slow tank-like unit that hits hard, but she is no match for a Skeleton Army where each skeleton is weak, but they move and hit fast. The Skeleton Army can be easily countered with e.g. a Valkyrie, which, in turn, cannot beat P.E.K.K.A. The catch is that you can only have eight different cards in your deck, but dozens of different cards exist, so you need to be strategic and versatile.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of an x7 Elixir game that I played, it&rsquo;s quite a mayhem compared to the slower, traditional game modes, but I like it:</p>

			 <p>I feel rather cheated by Intel&hellip; I got a new desktop PC in 2020 with an i7-10700K CPU that uses the then-brand-new LGA1200 socket, thinking that as it was brand new, it would have a long and happy life ahead of it and I could safely just upgrade the CPU in the future.</p>
<p>Well, they used the socket for like two years only. Apparently the socket life spans have gone down dramatically from what they were earlier (like 20 years ago; see e.g. the LGA 775 socket), but Intel is especially bad in this respect, vs. AMD who has longer socket life spans. AMD released the AM4 socket in 2016 and the next socket, AM5, wasn&rsquo;t released until 2022.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel bad for Intel when the news broke the other day that their stock value is plummeting. My next PC won&rsquo;t feature an Intel CPU.</p>
