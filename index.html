		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week, April 16-20, my family and I did an Easter holiday trip to LEGOLAND in Billund, Denmark. The kids had never been on a plane and Denmark is not too far away from Finland, so it was an easy start, plus LEGO bricks are close to our hearts, so it was a good match of new experiences.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-billund">Getting to Billund</h2>
<p>Our itinerary was such that first we flew from Helsinki to Copenhagen with Finnair. Their staff was very helpful already at the ground so we even got the baby pram onto the plane easily, a phase that I had been mildly nervous about beforehand. Even the security check went fine with me having the toddler in a front-carrier, although the 4yo was assigned to a random extra pat-down, which he bravely endured like he endures, say, a visit to the dentist.</p>
<p>At the Copenhagen airport we had lunch at Burger King, for which we had reserved plenty of time before the next leg, which was a ~2.5 hour train trip to Vejle. (At this early stage of the season Finnair does not have direct flights to Billund.) There was a little hiccup with the train tickets and the pram, as it&rsquo;s free to take the pram into the ICL trains there but you still need to reserve a spot for them. For some reason the booking system did not do the reservation &ndash; I still don&rsquo;t know if I did something wrong or if the system malfunctioned &ndash; so I ended up having to call their phone service, where they were luckily able to add the pram spot reservation. The train itself, once we got there, was quiet and comfortable.</p>
<p>At Vejle we had a quick transfer to a local bus 43. The ride took about 30 minutes and the bus dropped us right next to LEGOLAND and its hotels.</p>
<h2 id="in-billund">In Billund</h2>
<h3 id="hotel-legoland">Hotel LEGOLAND</h3>
<p>We had reserved something called a Kingdom Room, themed after the LEGO Castle subtheme, so naturally we headed for the big hotel building that looked like a castle. It turned out, however, that that hotel was called LEGOLAND Castle Hotel, and our reservation was next door in Hotel LEGOLAND. Confusing.</p>
<p>Hotel LEGOLAND looked from the outside like it was built in the 1970s, with the telltale floor tiles and a Functionalist-style porte-cochère. Indeed, checking from the Danish Wikipedia, it was established in 1968 as Esso Motor Hotel! The LEGO-themed hallways also seemed endless, but the slightly negative first impression turned better the next day after some rest and recovery.</p>
<p>In the hotel the kids had little gifts waiting for them in the room, and even the baby got his first Duplo set of about five pieces. The room also had a box of random LEGO bricks to build with, however it was pretty cramped all in all so there wasn&rsquo;t a good space to build, especially if you wanted to shield your creations from your little brother.</p>
<h3 id="lego-house">LEGO House</h3>
<p>The next day we headed for the LEGO House, &ldquo;Home of the Brick&rdquo; that was opened in 2017 a short 15-20 min walk away from the hotel. The LEGO House contains many activities, LEGO creations, building opportunities, a small library, some restaurants, a shop (with a disappointingly small pick-a-brick section), and a floor about the history of the company and the bricks. You could easily spend an entire day there, and we basically did. We later overheard some other tourists talking during dinner about how they visited both the LEGO House and LEGOLAND during the same day, but that seems mental madness to me.</p>
<p>One highlight in the LEGO House is an actual brick moulding machine that constantly pushes out new 2x4 bricks. You can follow its working through transparent panels, and it even wraps the bricks in packaging. The 1yo found this device hilarious: he could&rsquo;ve watched all day when the freshly minted bags of bricks fell down the conveyor belt. 😁 Every guest was welcome to take one bag of six bricks as a souvenir and it was accompanied by a personal, unique instruction on what to build with them. See, six bricks 2x4 LEGO bricks of the same color can be connected in 915,103,765 different ways, and there&rsquo;s some algorithm that assigns each guest one of them.</p>
<p>After the LEGO House we visited the roof of the building for a virtual geocache. The building even has activities on top of it in the form of various small playgrounds. The views could&rsquo;ve been nice on a sunny day, but that wasn&rsquo;t one of those days, so we quickly continued back to the hotel where the kids chased each other around a big castle-like jungle gym.</p>
<h3 id="lalandia">Lalandia</h3>
<p>Next, we headed to Lalandia for dinner. Lalandia is a &ldquo;tropical holiday centre&rdquo; some ten minutes walk away from the LEGOLAND hotels, opposite direction of the LEGO House, and it&rsquo;s pretty crazy! When you enter it, it&rsquo;s like one of those movie magic moments when you go into a room that&rsquo;s bigger on the inside than on the outside. Outside, Lalandia looks like a large, boring grey cube, but on the inside there&rsquo;s a realistic (but fake) blue sky with white clouds, and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in some Mediterranean town all of a sudden. There are restaurants, a bowling alley, shops, and even a water park. Just wow!</p>
<h3 id="legoland">LEGOLAND</h3>
<p>The next day was Friday, and that was the LEGOLAND day. Hotel LEGOLAND, it turns out, has a direct secret passage to LEGOLAND, but we walked across the street outside, only discovering the inside route later on our way back. Anyway, there were many people queuing into the park, but the line went really fast as people just got their pre-bought tickets scanned. No wristbands were issued either, unlike in the LEGO House.</p>
<p>LEGOLAND starts with the Miniland: cities around the world built (mostly) in 1:20 scale. There&rsquo;s also the modest 36 meters tall LEGOTOP observation tower attraction, but when you look at Miniland from up there it&rsquo;s equivalent to looking at real buildings from the altitude of 720 meters! And when I said &ldquo;mostly&rdquo;, I mean to exclude for example the Burj Khalifa, which, if built to scale, would have needed to be some 40 meters tall, whereas now it&rsquo;s there as an &ldquo;only&rdquo; 5.5 meters tall LEGO structure.</p>
<p>As for the rides the 4 and 8 year olds found the blue &ldquo;high-speed merry-go-round&rdquo; Caterpillar the best. There was also a pirate ship shaped jungle gym that was a hit, and The Dragon roller-coaster, which had a bit longer queue. Next to the haunted house was a place to build your own monsters, I think the 4yo could&rsquo;ve spent his day over those bricks just fine too.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, the restaurants weren&rsquo;t really family-friendly: you weren&rsquo;t allowed to take a pram into any of them, even the one called Family Buffet! This presented a problem as our little one was sleeping, but at least we were allowed to remove the carrycot and bring that one in. Then, of course, we had to make sure nobody tripped over it, so it wasn&rsquo;t an optimal solution either. Furthermore there was just one line to all the foods, and as everyone got hungry the same time, it was a long one, so you wanted to fill your plate to the max in just one go.</p>
<p>Anyway, we survived the lunch experience. In the evening we had a three course dinner at the hotel restaurant, and that was a good one. As a bonus the restaurant, of course, had a LEGO building corner for kids, so we could dump the kids there for a while once they&rsquo;d eaten their buffet meals of LEGO brick shaped fries and whatnot.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-billund">Leaving Billund</h2>
<p>We had thought to leave Billund for Copenhagen the same way we came: by local bus and a train. It turned out, however, that the trains there don&rsquo;t really do weekends that well! We would&rsquo;ve needed to use a &ldquo;togbus&rdquo;, or train bus, i.e. a bus that replaces a train connection, and there would&rsquo;ve been more transfers. What finally killed this path for us was that a baby would&rsquo;ve needed their own safety seat in those buses! So, we just booked a 50 minute SAS flight from Billund to Copenhagen instead.</p>
<p>The Billund airport is the second largest in Denmark, but still, as you might guess, pretty small. There&rsquo;s maybe four restaurants and you can see them all in the same place. We had some snacks and then had an uneventful ATR 72 flight.</p>
<h1 id="copenhagen">Copenhagen</h1>
<p>We arrived to the now-familiar Copenhagen airport at about 16:30 and after collecting our luggage headed for the trains, as we knew from Wednesday where they left from. The local trains weren&rsquo;t sticking to their schedule back then and they weren&rsquo;t doing it this time either, but the wait wasn&rsquo;t too long anyway, and the trip itself was something around ten minutes.</p>
<p>Our hotel was called Good Morning City Copenhagen Star and it was basically right next to the central railway station. The room got a spontaneous &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; from the kids, being light and spacious compared to the dim and crammed, more traditional hotel room we had at Hotel LEGOLAND. Indeed, the room had the possibility to fit five adults and a baby crib without feeling tight! The staff was also super helpful and friendly and, when we asked for recommendations for &ldquo;anything but hamburgers&rdquo;, pointed us to a nearby restaurant called Frk. Barners Kælder that served local food. 😋 I had a huge Wiener Schnitzel and the kids had some stew and a part of my schnitzel, as I had a part of their minced beef steak too.</p>
<p>The next morning we had a good breakfast at the hotel and headed to see the Nyhavn area, that we&rsquo;d also seen in Miniland the day before yesterday, by metro. The metro is fully automatic so that you can see directly into the tunnel from both ends of the train, and the kids found this fascinating. The 4yo especially appreciated the controls that were painted or sticker&rsquo;d into the table in front of the window and guided the train and its doors enthusiastically through the tunnels and stations. 🚇</p>
<p>After Nyhavn we still had to make a visit to a LEGO store for some souvenirs &ndash; we hadn&rsquo;t picked up any sets from LEGOLAND or the Lego House. An open store was found at the entrance of the Tivoli amusement park, right outside of it. The store has two floors and is not too big, but it had Star Wars sets, and that&rsquo;s all we needed. My wife thought that 75383 Darth Maul&rsquo;s Sith Infiltrator would&rsquo;ve been cool, but the younger one counted the minifigures and set his sights to the 75372 Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack. The older one, however, saw a cool new Jedi character in 75378 BARC Speeder Escape, so as a compromise&hellip; we got them both.</p>
<p>After this it was time to get our bags from the hotel and head for the airport. As we had learned the local trains had troubles with their schedules, and the automatic metro was a more pleasant method of travel anyway, we took the metro instead. There was a transfer in the middle so we arrived to the airport a bit later than we&rsquo;d wanted, but still didn&rsquo;t need to rush.</p>
<p>Once we had packed the pram again and dropped them and the other luggage off, the 4yo won <em>another</em> extra security scrutiny check. 😂 (Pro tip: if you&rsquo;ve bought a large bag to cover the pram in the plane cargo space, remove it from your luggage <em>before</em> dropping the luggage to be taken to the plane so that you have it when you start packing the pram.) Then we walked through the tax-free shop and spent our last krones to some sweets and cookies. (We actually had just a tiny amount of local money and used a card everywhere.)</p>
<p>After all this the clock had advanced by a surprisingly large number of minutes, so we beelined to the other end of the airport for our gate. If the Billund airport had been small, the Copenhagen one is huge! It handles some 30 million passengers annually, roughly twice the number the Helsinki airport does. So the walk took some 15 minutes, after which we barely had time for a quick toilet break before the gate opened for boarding.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite the minimal planning ahead of the trip (booking the Billund-Copenhagen flight was an embarrassingly last minute addition to the itinerary) the trip was a great success. The older kids will hopefully have something to reminisce for years &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s the fancy jungle gym at the hotel, or the Copenhagen metro. The little one, of course, won&rsquo;t remember a thing, but it was still heartwarming to see how happy he, too, was when he realized on Sunday evening that he was finally getting back to his very own bed at home. ♥️</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t watch a lot of Finnish dramas, but 2025 will be written in history for me, as I&rsquo;ve already seen three great shows this year, which is about three more than I can remember from the decade before.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, there was <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27579939/">Konflikti</a></em>, aired by MTV3. Technically it was late 2024, but I&rsquo;ll include it here anyway. In the series unmarked green men attack and take over the Hanko peninsula in the very southernmost point of mainland Finland. The show follows several different people or groups of people. A group of conscripts were practicing in the area when the incident started and are now trying to survive in the middle of an actual enemy; special forces are conducting a reconnaissance mission to the invaded area; the president and the prime minister have very different opinions on how to resolve the situation; and some more.</p>
<p>The very first episode caught me by surprise with some professional military slang that was not explained &ndash; you just had to know or deduce it from the context. So the dialog is well written and the budget has been big for a Finnish show, with tanks, ships, and fighter jets zooming around. The show lasts for just six episodes, so there is not too much space for character development, but the characters are different and believable enough. 💥</p>
<hr>
<p>The next show I watched was <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33338105/">Queen of Fucking Everything</a></em> by Yle. This show follows Linda, a middle-aged woman who is accustomed to a pretty wealthy life with his perfect husband. However, the man turns out to be a scammer, leaving Linda drowning in debt. Linda tries her very best to cover her misfortune and sudden loss of credit records from her coworkers — the kind of people who buy expensive coffees from baristas and then might just abandon them if a meeting comes up &ndash; which pisses Linda off, naturally, if it was her turn to buy those coffees with the money she just got from a pawn shop.</p>
<p>The show gets increasingly unhinged in the best way. Eventually Linda, who turns out to be extremely resourceful but also very ruthless if need be, even gets involved with organized crime.</p>
<p>When watching the show you never know where it&rsquo;s going. Sometimes it takes on some very dark tones, and sometimes the viewer can rightfully think that Linda is quite a bitch, but at the same time you still root for her, as she never asked to be dropped into a blender of social shame and financial ruin. 💸</p>
<hr>
<p>The last show I&rsquo;d like to highlight is <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29083876/">Kurjen kirous</a></em> by Nelonen. In this one the main character is an actor named Aki Kurki (played by Kari Ketonen). Aki is stuck in forgettable mediocre supporting roles. He&rsquo;s convinced he&rsquo;s meant for greater things and can&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s never cast in anything significant. At one point he tells his manager Hannu (the great Antti Holma) that he doesn&rsquo;t want to do any &ldquo;crazy neighbors&rdquo; anymore, which is a fun nod towards Kari Ketonen&rsquo;s role as a crazy neighbor in another great show called <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6248306/">Luottomies</a></em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Aki is cast as a fortune teller in some show. The role is very small, but being the serious actor he is, he prepares diligently by booking an appointment with an actual fortune teller. The man offers to do a reading for Aki and finds out that Aki has a curse on him. Being a rationalist Aki walks out from the session &ndash; only to witness a smaller prediction by the fortune teller come true.</p>
<p>This offers Aki an explanation for his stalled career: it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s had bad luck or anything, but he has been cursed! So, he embarks on a side quest to find out who cursed him, and whether that person could lift the curse, allowing his career to finally take off.</p>
<p>Aki, like Linda in <em>Queen of Fucking Everything</em>, is a multi-faceted character: he is often arrogant and self-important, but at the same time he&rsquo;s trying to mend his relationship with his teenage daughter and to maintain other relationships too. And of course he takes acting very seriously &ndash; just not always the productions he&rsquo;s in if he doesn&rsquo;t think they have the artistic value he&rsquo;d deserve. 🎭</p>
<hr>
<p>So there you have it: three good Finnish TV shows that might some day even make it abroad as adaptations. Watch these if you get the chance. 📺</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to the <a href="https://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> podcast for some eight or nine years already, and it is in fact the <a href="https://ville.saalo.moi/2025/02/24/hello-people-i-just-learned.html">reason I created myself a Micro.blog blog</a> in the first place. Scott is an empathetic and knowledgeable host and the guests and topics are diverse. Furthermore, I find the half an hour episode length just perfect for commutes when I listen to the show at an ever so slightly increased 1.1x speed. 🎙️</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.hanselminutes.com/991/tiny-experiments-with-anne-laure-le-cunff">episode #991</a> Scott had a chat with Dr. Anne-Laure Le Cunff about her new book <em>Tiny Experiments</em>. What resonated with me in the show was when they discussed that people are being too absolute about the things they want to do or be. Way too often someone announces that they, say, will start going to a gym, then buy a membership for a year, and then slowly find out it&rsquo;s not for them after all after the first couple of months. This is then considered a failure and will negatively affect their self image.</p>
<p>The better way to do this would&rsquo;ve been to think that I think I might like going to a gym, then buy a membership for a month, and then just try it out. If you didn&rsquo;t like going to a gym then fine, you tried, your hypothesis proved to be wrong, you learned something without losing too much time or money. It was a learning experience instead of a failure.</p>
<p>In a sense this entire blog is a tiny experiment for myself. I have no idea if I&rsquo;ll still be blogging in a year, but so far I&rsquo;ve been enjoying it, and it&rsquo;s certainly not too expensive when Micro.blog plans start at just $1 per month (which is the plan I&rsquo;m currently using).</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s something to ponder about. If you have children, you tell them that it&rsquo;s alright and indeed encouraged to just <em>try</em>, you don&rsquo;t need to succeed. At which point does an adult switch to a mode where it&rsquo;s not OK to &ldquo;just try&rdquo; but you&rsquo;re expected to commit and succeed?</p>

			 <p>This time there&rsquo;s a common theme with the links: color. 🎨 I&rsquo;ve recently been subtly tweaking the colors of my blog, so I&rsquo;ve (re)discovered these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM accessibility checker</a>. Check that the contrast between foreground and background colors is big enough. You don&rsquo;t even need to be old or have bad eyesight to benefit from good contrast, as sometimes the external circumstances like a glare on your screen make the text hard to read if the contrast is not there. There&rsquo;s really no excuse for bad contrast.</li>
<li>Name all the colors at <a href="https://colornames.org/">Color Names.org</a>. This is a fun effort to name all the 16,777,216 colors in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">RGB color space</a>. Almost a quarter of the colors have been named as of writing this. No need to register, just pick a color and think of a name for it! For example, the dark mode background color of this blog is called <a href="https://colornames.org/color/1d1c16">Oriental Popcornflower</a>. 🍿💐</li>
<li>macOS has a built-in utility app called <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/digital-color-meter/welcome/mac">Digital Color Meter</a> with which you can pick the color code of anything on your screen.</li>
<li>Finally, an infuriating optical illusion: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opticalillusions/comments/1dak6vg/the_two_faces_are_the_same_color/">these two faces are the same color</a>! The illusion is based on a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy">color constancy</a>, where the surrounding context tricks our brain.</li>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781407034393">The Light Fantastic</a> by Terry Pratchett 📚</p>
<p><em>The Light Fantastic</em> picks up exactly where <em>The Colour of Magic</em> left off: the wizard Rincewind and the tourist Twoflower are in serious trouble. Beyond their personal predicament, it turns out the entire Discworld is facing an existential threat.</p>
<p>While dodging both general and personal dangers, Rincewind and Twoflower encounter trolls and join forces with the legendary Hero, Cohen the Barbarian. Tales of Cohen’s heroic deeds have been told for decades, so naturally, the man himself turns out to be 87 years old. Still, he gets a bit offended if fewer than five enemies attack him at once — after all, life gets boring without a challenge.</p>
<p>In this book, Sir Terry Pratchett seems to have reined in his ideas a bit, resulting in a more coherent story than the first one. That said, I still preferred <em>The Colour of Magic</em>, since the whole “saving the world” plot in <em>The Light Fantastic</em> felt a bit tacked on. Still, it wasn&rsquo;t a bad read by any means.</p>

			 <p>Three random things!</p>
<ul>
<li>Something to listen. My brilliant colleague Annika Madejska, who is something of a thought-leader in the ethics of AI, was recently interviewed in the <a href="https://creativeleadership.libsyn.com/the-story-of-annika-madejska-ethical-debt-ai-and-neurodiversity">Creative Leaders Unplugged</a> podcast. Listen to the episode where she shares not only her thoughts about ethics and AI, but about having ADHD, or being &ldquo;neuro-spicy&rdquo;, as she puts it! Listen on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ZY04B4NbNTUaDtlNOLHbE">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/nl/podcast/the-story-of-annika-madejska-ethical-debt/id1517638543?i=1000701237825&amp;l=en-GB">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZByboJn2YUI">YouTube</a>.</li>
<li>Something to read. I don&rsquo;t use Facebook a lot, but one of the best groups there is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedullclub/">Dull Men&rsquo;s Club®️</a>. People make long posts with images about mundane stuff they&rsquo;re excited about &ndash; think parking lots, drain covers, and envelopes &ndash; and the general vibe just is so supportive compared to your usual toxicity of the internet. As an inside joke, the images are often expected to contain a banana for scale. 🍌</li>
<li>Something to watch. <a href="https://youtube.com/@lastweektonight"><em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em></a> is an American half an hour long news satire late-night talk show with British sarcasm.

			 <p>When you&rsquo;ve been long enough in the software development business you start to notice patterns. One of those patterns recently surfaced again when someone in my team floated the idea that our system should be able to read or write Excel files. I&rsquo;ve seen and implemented this particular request so many times that I got inspired to write it down as an adage. I&rsquo;ve dubbed it <em>Saalo&rsquo;s Law of Software Development</em> and it goes as follows:</p>
<p><em><strong>Every piece of enterprise software eventually evolves into either reading or writing Excel files.</strong></em></p>
<p>I originally posted this just to the company Slack where my peers unanimously agreed that yes, this is exactly what happens. There&rsquo;s something about spreadsheets that makes them the universal translator of the business world &ndash; no matter how sophisticated your system, someone always needs that Excel import or export function.</p>
<p>So there you have my humble observation on how enterprise software works. My law may not be as well known (yet!) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brooks'</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&rsquo;s</a> laws, but maybe one day. 😁</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I was scrolling through my feed when I came across a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7311760309575151616">short video by Allie K. Miller</a>, who&rsquo;s something of a thought leader in the AI business space. She mentioned that you probably use AI already, but asked if you&rsquo;re <em>really using</em> it? AI can enable so many novel use cases that merely enhancing your old processes is kind of wasting its full potential.</p>
<p>It made me stop and think. Like many, I&rsquo;ve been using AI tools here and there - asking ChatGPT to help with writing, generating some ideas, maybe summarizing content. But am I actually reimagining how I work?</p>
<p>Allie mentioned how after 10 years of creating AI content (7 of those without AI tools), she completely rebuilt her workflow. Now she dictates to Otter AI while walking, runs her content through multiple AI systems, and formats everything in Beehiiv with auto-links. More steps, but apparently 80% time saved. That&rsquo;s not just enhancement.</p>
<p>I wonder if most of us are in that &ldquo;scratching the surface&rdquo; phase with AI that Allie mentions. We&rsquo;re asking AI to help with tasks we already do, rather than rethinking what tasks we should be doing in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously not using AI to its fullest potential either. My current workflows still look pretty much like they did a couple of years ago, with some AI assistance sprinkled in rather than built around them. There&rsquo;s something to think about there.</p>
<p>(By the way, I don&rsquo;t often subscribe to newsletters, but I do follow Allie&rsquo;s work. If any of this piqued your interest, you might want to check out her newsletter at <a href="https://aiwithallie.beehiiv.com/subscribe?ref=z6NeejKck1">AI with Allie</a>.)</p>

			 <p>When it comes to household chores, ironing is one of my favorites as it often allows me to shorten my &ldquo;Watch later&rdquo; playlist (771 videos there as of writing this&hellip;) in YouTube. Last time I did ironing I watched this cool video of an ant colony simulator:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The fun thing is that it creates fascinating emergent behavior from a few simple rules. The ants walk around randomly, leaving behind a trail of pheromones like breadcrumbs pointing back home, and when they encounter food, they pick some up and follow the pheromone trail back to the nest. While carrying food they leave behind another type of pheromone that point the ants to the food source.</p>
<p>This seemed like an interesting exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">vibe coding</a> where you just describe your need in your own words and let an AI do the actual programming for you. Vibe coding seems to split the opinions sharply: some find that it makes coding more equal and available to anyone, others loathe the idea of an influx of AI-generated trash.</p>
<p>My take is that AI is a tool. Just as you don&rsquo;t become a better photographer by buying a more expensive camera, you don&rsquo;t become a (better) programmer by using smarter tools. If you are prone to creating bugs without AI, then AI just enhances your ability to create those bugs faster.</p>
<p>But sometimes it does not matter. If you&rsquo;re working on a hobby project for yourself and you&rsquo;re only running it locally, then it might as well have all the security holes in the world. However, the situation quickly changes if you deploy your application online and it has a backend to store any kind of a state.</p>
<p>Also an important reason for this exercise to me, besides wanting to watch virtual ants, was simply to keep up with and assess the current state of AI code generation. We seem to be heading towards ever more advanced and omnipresent AI tools, so it&rsquo;s for the best if you start getting familiar with them already.</p>
<p>So, how did it go? I&rsquo;ve had successes with vibe coding so I was very optimistic. I wish I could tell you it was a great success: that I gave ChatGPT one prompt and it gave me a working piece of code right away, and then I spent an hour watching my new virtual ant colony do its things. Alas, it was not a great success.</p>
<p>I started with ChatGPT 4o and described what I wanted to it: a simple ant colony simulator that runs in a browser, and where the ants leave pheromone trails and follow them. Emergent behavior from simple rules, like in the YouTube video I had watched. The system quickly blurted me out an HTML file with Javascript, and it was very promising. The simulation even launched successfully and ants began crawling around! You could even place down the nest, the food, and some walls, though the UI was clunky &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t even see the item you placed the simulation was running.</p>
<p>I started to iterate the app with ChatGPT, giving it feedback on what works and what does not and got it improved a bit. Then, however, it seemed as if the system started to lose the context: features that had worked stopped working randomly on new iterations. I restarted the process a few times with new prompts and with the o3-mini-high model, but the results were similar. The AI either went for an overly complex model that didn&rsquo;t work, or left it too simple and added shortcut rules that broke the idea of emergent behavior from simple rules. For example, the AI thought that it would be great if an ant carrying food could head directly to the nest, no need to follow any pheromone trail. Needless to say, that isn&rsquo;t what I want.</p>
<p>Next I tried with a local Qwen2.5-Coder, running on Ollama and <a href="https://www.openwebui.com/">Open WebUI</a>. This seemed promising at first when Open WebUI even opened a browser frame next to the prompt as the model was coming up with the code. However, that approach didn&rsquo;t work at all when the model split the HTML and the Javascript to different files, and the UI wasn&rsquo;t made for such a complex setup. I might have retried with a refined prompt to ask it to output all the code into the same file, but I think it fell for one of the mistakes I had already seen ChatGPT make. Also I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to restart the preview frame if I lost it due to, say, refreshing the window, which was a let-down.</p>
<p>Finally I tried the new Google AI Studio with the Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 model. Previously I had tried to just give the models the task to create the app in one go, but now I had a different approach. I told the model I wanted it to make me an ant colony simulator, but not yet: we should plan it first.</p>
<p>So, next I asked Gemini to explain me like I&rsquo;m five how ants in real life find food and then back to the nest. I adapted this approach from Zach Bart, founder of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics">Zachtronics</a>, my favorite puzzle game studio. He mentioned in some interview that when he wants to make a new thematic game about, say, chemistry, he checks the teaching material about that subject available for some 10-15 year old kids, because that hits the sweet spot for what most people would find plausible enough but not overly complicated.</p>
<p>Gemini provided me with the description, I asked a few clarifying questions, and off we went again. This time I made the additional request to use the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library, which is apparently very popular with these kind of apps requiring simple graphics. Unfortunately, Gemini&rsquo;s result was the only one that didn&rsquo;t do anything at all once run! I quickly debugged it having an invalid reference to the HTML element that was supposed to host the arena, though, and again the ants started crawling. But, long story short, Gemini made roughly the same mistakes that ChatGPT had made, like giving the ants a magical compass pointing to the nest, despite explicitly being told to have them follow the pheromone trails.</p>
<p>In the end this was all about the journey, not the end result, so I don&rsquo;t mind not having my own ant colony simulator. Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s cumbersome when you need to copy-paste generated code around. The generation should be integrated directly into your actual development environment. You can even do all this with your phone only, but that is <em>very</em> cumbersome.</li>
<li>If you try to avoid coding, you&rsquo;ll just end up debugging someone else&rsquo;s (the AI&rsquo;s) code. I, for one, usually prefer writing new code to debugging old one. And when the code is not made by yourself, you don&rsquo;t have a mental model of it, so debugging takes a lot of time.</li>
<li>The technology is advancing fast. I have no doubt that some other model could&rsquo;ve successfully created a proper ant colony simulator already, or that the models I tried now will be able to do it in a year.</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and indeed I hope to revisit this topic in the future.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781407034379">The Colour Of Magic</a> by Terry Pratchett 📚</p>
<p>According to a legend, somewhere on the far side of the Disc, beyond the great sea, lies the Counterweight Continent. Since it&rsquo;s assumed to balance the Disc’s other landmasses, yet appears relatively small, it’s believed to consist largely of heavy gold. Few sane people, of course, believe this story — until one day, a ship sailing up the smelly Morpork river brings a Tourist to the shores of Ankh-Morpork.</p>
<p>The locals don’t understand what a &ldquo;tourist&rdquo; is, but quickly deduce it means roughly the same as &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;. The man dresses oddly, acts strangely, and carries an absurd amount of gold — whose value he doesn’t seem to grasp. He’s also accompanied by a sentient pearwood chest, the Luggage, which is generally docile but turns into an unstoppable, murderous beast if its master is threatened.</p>
<p>Rincewind, a wizard who failed utterly at wizardry and is mostly a coward — though otherwise fairly clever — finds that he can speak the tourist’s language. The tourist, Twoflower, hires Rincewind as his guide. Soon, Ankh-Morpork is entirely ablaze, and Rincewind and Twoflower are fleeing by land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>The Colour of Magic launched the now-famous Discworld series in 1983, and over thirty novels have followed. Quite the achievement, especially considering this book alone is so packed with ideas and events that it feels like Pratchett wanted to include every concept he had.</p>
<p>I originally borrowed the book for my second grader, but after he found it too confusing after the first couple dozen pages, I ended up reading it myself. I’ve probably read it long ago, but Pratchett’s absurd British humor still hits the mark for me — and presumably for other fans of Monty Python and Douglas Adams as well.</p>

			 <p>About a week ago I was exploring other random blogs when I came across the <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2025/3/7-things-this-week-172">7 Things This Week [#172]</a> post by Jarrod Blundy. What caught my eye was the number on the title: Jarrod has been persistently listing seven things each week for more than three years already! In this day and age of single-click fire-and-forget retweets I find it admirable that someone can resist that urge to share the links immediately and do instead a little bit of curating, even adding a sentence or two of their own justifying why a particular link is interesting.</p>
<p>It surprised me too that literally just a random collection of links had this effect on me, so I dug deeper using Gemini&rsquo;s new Deep Research feature. (And this time I mean that <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Google AI</a>, not the <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/16/gemini-protocol.html">Gemini protocol</a>.) I must say Gemini is impressive: it formed a research plan according to my ramblings, then went away and crunched the internet for maybe ten minutes or so, and eventually returned with a convincing full report of the history of &ldquo;lists of things&rdquo; in print and online media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with all the details, but I learned, for example, that the <em>Time</em> magazine started a Potpourri column of random things already in 1923. For the online world, an early example of something similar is Dave Winer&rsquo;s DaveNet newsletter that started in 1994. I looked it up and found the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/about.html">DaveNet archive</a> &ndash; and oh boy isn&rsquo;t it a treasure trove if you&rsquo;re interested in the early world wide web! Dave covered, for example, the browser wars that <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/20/vivaldi-browser.html">I also recently referred to</a>, and the rise of the new and exciting programming language called Java. Dave wrote his newsletter for ten years and posted between one and a dozed emails each month, so check it out!</p>
<p>As for myself, I won&rsquo;t dare to commit to posting a regular list of things, but I&rsquo;ll keep the concept in mind and start now with a very short list. Specifically, it&rsquo;s a shout out to a couple of my favorite YouTubers and their most recent work.</p>

			 <p>I figured it would be an interesting little challenge to condense the plot of the original <em>Star Wars</em> into a very short format, but with as many spoilers as possible. I settled for a limit of one hundred words. Here goes; maybe you can use it as a refresher if you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie in a while, but quit reading now if you haven&rsquo;t seen it and want to watch and fully enjoy it later: 🍿</p>

			 <p>Around the turn of the millennium the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a> were a thing. The first browser war saw Netscape Navigator unsuccessfully defend against the new Microsoft Internet Explorer. After a few years the remains of Netscape Navigator were forged into a new browser called Phoenix, soon renamed to Firebird, and finally to Firefox. I, however, stayed strongly in camp Opera during this time.</p>
<p>Opera was developed by a Norwegian company by the same name, and it was by far the most innovative browser of the time. They were the first ones to introduce tabs, a speed dial window, customizable shortcuts, quick search bar, and, my favorite, mouse gestures: to go back in the history, press and hold the right mouse button, swipe left, and release. Extremely simple and efficient, and there were gestures for all the other commands you could wish for, too. Opera also recognized the importance of a community and successfully ran the My Opera site for years.</p>
<p>My Opera was, unfortunately, shut down in 2014. Then, two years later in 2016, Opera was sold to China, and I stopped using it. In the same year, however, the former CEO of Opera Software released the first stable version of a new browser called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi_(web_browser)">Vivaldi</a>.</p>
<p>Vivaldi is to me the spiritual successor of Opera. You get the familiar full customizability and a bunch of features out of the box that other browsers can only have as plugins, if even that. Notoriously, Google recently basically removed the extremely popular uBlock Origin ad blocker from their plugin store, obviously because showing ads to you is their primary business. 😬 Other than ad blocking and tracker blocking, Vivaldi has, for example, a feed reader, tiling &amp; stacking of tabs, the aforementioned mouse gestures, themes, and much more.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about the <a href="https://zeroone.micro.blog/2025/03/18/kagi-search.html">Kagi Search</a>, to which someone who read it could&rsquo;ve wondered if I use the Chrome browser anyway, in which case my privacy wouldn&rsquo;t be any more protected with Kagi than it is with Google. I do need Chrome for work, but at home I use Vivaldi and haven&rsquo;t signed in to my Google account with it. I&rsquo;m under no illusion that Google wouldn&rsquo;t still be able to track me, but at least I don&rsquo;t need to make it trivial to them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a browser that puts you in control, Vivaldi is worth a try. Get it from <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">vivaldi.com</a> to give it a spin!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>About three months ago I ditched Google as my primary search engine and started using <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> instead &ndash; and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<p>Kagi is a subscription based service: you get to test it for free for one hundred searches, and if you are satisfied, you can start with the 5 USD/month (+tax) plan that includes 300 searches. I&rsquo;ve found that with my usage I can usually manage about 27 days, after which I can just renew the monthly subscription a bit early with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>Why pay for your search engine, then, when Google is free? Well, the old saying goes that if you&rsquo;re not paying for the product, then you are the product. In practice this means that you will be shown lots of ads and &ldquo;sponsored links&rdquo; &ndash; which are just ads by another name. It seems that companies often buy ads that target their competitors too, so if you&rsquo;re looking for info about product X of company Y, then the first &ldquo;search results&rdquo; you get are actually about the competing product Z by company W. All this gets quite tiring in the long run. I also noticed that not only because of this but because of ChatGPT my Google searches had dropped dramatically. Google just didn&rsquo;t have any pull anymore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Kagi doing better, then? For one, they don&rsquo;t have ads, so they are not incentivized to serve any advertisers but you, the user. For a user there are some neat features, such as increasing or decreasing the priority of any sites in your search results, something that I have indeed missed in Google. Kagi also has a delightful <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Small Web initiative</a> highlighting little personal sites that you couldn&rsquo;t find with Google even by accident. Kagi also has an actual <a href="https://kagi.com/changelog">changelog</a> &ndash; when have you ever seen a search engine, or any major web site for that, display one proudly? These little details make Kagi feel like it&rsquo;s made by humans for humans. <a href="https://dkb.io/post/DEPR_kagi-interview">Kagi&rsquo;s origin story</a> is also worth reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s a growing sense that people are tired of being the product and of the general enshittification of the web. People want control over their own their data, they don&rsquo;t want Meta, Google, or that dumpster fire X deciding what they may access and see. You constantly get to read about people and businesses that are locked out of their Instagram accounts for no apparent reason and there&rsquo;s nothing they can do to appeal because it&rsquo;s all handled by some faceless algorithms. That&rsquo;s a contributing factor also to why I&rsquo;m using the Micro.blog platform for hosting this blog and why I&rsquo;m using Kagi: I want to support the smaller players that are still trying to Do The Right Thing.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There is a common misconception that energy drinks have a particularly high caffeine concentration. Often the people who fuss over this are coffee drinkers themselves.</p>
<p>Energy drinks typically have 32 mg of caffeine per 100 ml. This translates to the following total amounts of caffeine per container:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Container Size</th>
<th>Caffeine (mg)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.25 L</td>
<td>80 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.33 L</td>
<td>106 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.5 L</td>
<td>160 mg</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, coffee on the other hand has about 44,8 - 80 mg of caffeine per 100 ml, translating to the following dozages:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Container Size</th>
<th>Caffeine (mg) (Range)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.125 L (small cup)</td>
<td>56 - 100 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.2 L (medium mug)</td>
<td>90 - 160 mg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.25 L (large mug)</td>
<td>112 - 250 mg</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(<a href="https://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/dlk01123">Source</a>)</p>
<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s the same as an image &ndash; I hope that by now you&rsquo;ll agree that if you want to be worried about someone getting too much caffeine, you should be worried of those who drink coffee. Coffee doesn&rsquo;t even come with any warnings of the max recommended servings per day, unlike energy drinks. And this post doesn&rsquo;t even begin to address espresso, which is about four times as strong as regular coffee!</p>

Gemini in this case does not refer to Google&rsquo;s AI service but an application layer internet protocol developed quite recently, in 2019.</p>
<p>Gemini is kind of like HTTP but very, very simple. Gemini&rsquo;s preferred document format is gemtext, which is almost a subset of Markdown: you get headers and lists (but no nested lists) and hyperlinks (that need to be on their own line). You also get quotes and preformatted text for presenting code, but that&rsquo;s it. It does not support, for example, styles or inline images.</p>
<p>No normal browser supports Gemini. The &ldquo;Geminispace&rdquo; can, however, be accessed by a number of custom browsers that can use the <code>gemini://</code> protocol. Anyone can host a Gemini &ldquo;capsule&rdquo; by themself, or use one of the free or paid services to do that.</p>
<p>Somehow I find the idea behind Gemini quite appealing: no ads; no big companies trying to hook you or exploit you; no competing for likes or subscriptions; quick loading times; pages where the content speaks for itself. Even the mobile versions of many web sites are rather heavy these days, which can be observed if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to use the internet while traveling in a plane, but Gemini pages promise to be even more light-weight.</p>

			 <p>Last night it was confirmed that the band KAJ would represent Sweden in this year&rsquo;s Eurovision Song Contest. This is funny, because KAJ is, in fact, a Finnish band, so in a sense Finland now has two entries in this year&rsquo;s contest! 😁 KAJ&rsquo;s song is called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bara_bada_bastu">Bara bada bastu</a></em>, and Finland is sending Erika to the contest with <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_komme">Ich komme</a></em>:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve watched the Oscars live broadcast close to twenty times now, and I&rsquo;d argue that&rsquo;s no mean feat, as they are aired here in Finland in the middle of the night. I also post my observations about the show to Facebook every year,  and several of my friends there have indicated, either offline or online, that they always look forward to my recap. Waking up in the middle of the night to watch the Oscars feels like madness already, but tradition is tradition! The best way to stay awake is to keep eating snacks. 🍿 The following is a summary of my live observations.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s ceremony faced an unusual challenge, as the wildfires in Hollywood came dangerously close to disrupting the event. Host Conan O&rsquo;Brien even had to relocate to a hotel due to the fires.</p>
<p>Conan was hosting for the first time, but he made the show his own right from the start. He had some sharp quips, like calling <em>Wicked</em> <em>“a movie for those who watched <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and wondered what college was like for the side characters”</em> and describing <em>Conclave</em> as <em>“a movie about the Catholic Church — but don’t worry.”</em> He also introduced a new concept: if someone’s speech ran too long, the cameras would cut to John Lithgow, looking extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>One of the surprises came early in the night when Kieran Culkin won Best Supporting Actor for <em>A Real Pain</em>. In his speech, he reminded his wife of a promise she made a year ago: they could try for a fourth child if he won an Oscar — something she might not have expected to happen. 😄</p>
<p>In animation, the underdog triumphed as the Latvian film <em>Flow</em> took home Best Animated Feature, breaking the usual Disney/Pixar dominance. Meanwhile, the Iranian short <em>In the Shadow of the Cypress</em>, a PTSD-themed animation, won Best Animated Short, with its creators only receiving their visas the day before the ceremony.</p>
<p>Unlike previous years, the Costume Design category was given proper attention instead of being rushed through. It was revealed that the same designer from the original <em>Gladiator</em> worked on <em>Gladiator II</em>. The Oscar went to Paul Tazewell for <em>Wicked</em>, making him the first Black man to win in this category.</p>
<p>Similarly, cinematographers were introduced with the same care. Lol Crawley won for <em>The Brutalist</em>, marking the film’s first win of the night. <em>The Brutalist</em> also picked up Best Actor (Adrien Brody) and Best Score, with Brody ignoring attempts to play him offstage.</p>
<p>The first half of the show moved at a leisurely pace, even including a random Bond theme medley, but things sped up in the second half as winners were hurried offstage &ndash; although nobody got the ultimate punishment of getting the disappointed look from John Lithgow.</p>
<p>Other notable wins included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Adapted Screenplay: <em>Conclave</em>, written by Peter Straughan, who wore a Ukraine pin but otherwise, the ceremony remained largely apolitical.</li>
<li>Best Makeup and Hairstyling: <em>The Substance</em>, a body horror film. Conan played into this by introducing himself in a clip where he crawled out of Demi Moore&rsquo;s body. 😈</li>
<li>Best Supporting Actress: Zoe Saldaña for <em>Emilia Pérez</em>, whose speech included a complement about her husband&rsquo;s hair.</li>
<li>Best Original Song: <em>El Mal</em> from <em>Emilia Pérez</em>, dashing Diane Warren&rsquo;s hopes for a win — her 16th nomination without a victory.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the few winners I had actually seen, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, won for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. At one point, Conan even had the Dune sandworm playing the piano and harp, because why not? 😂</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s biggest winner was undoubtedly Sean Baker&rsquo;s <em>Anora</em>. It took home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Original Screenplay (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best  (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best Director (Sean Baker)</li>
<li>Best Actress (Mikaela &ldquo;Mikey&rdquo; Madison)</li>
<li>Best Picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Baker dedicated his wins to the importance of cinema and gave a special shoutout to his mother, whose birthday was that day.</p>
<p>The In Memoriam segment honored legends like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Smith">Maggie Smith</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">James Earl Jones</a>. The ceremony finally wrapped up an hour later than last year at about 05:45, well before the sunrise at 07:12.</p>

<p>Finnish games introduced briefly, but also contains a handful of interesting interviews. 🎮</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think about what your average citizen of today should know about the demoscene, the least would be the fact that such a long line of digital culture exists. Even if it&rsquo;s quite hidden from the mainstream, it has given rise to a huge amount of talent. Another is the existence of such media art and a community, of which not much is known, but which has been very active and played a significant part for those involved. Rather than thinking of whatever useful business skills were acquired, I would like the latter point to be the takeaway from all this.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell_(company)">Supercell</a> is a pretty successful Finnish mobile game company. I have been enjoying Clash Royale in particular. It&rsquo;s a real time game where you have a deck of cards that can bring units to the battle arena, and with them you try to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s King Tower. Cards are played with elixir that regenerates all the time, more or less slowly, depending on the game mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like rock-paper-scissors: for example, P.E.K.K.A is a huge, slow tank-like unit that hits hard, but she is no match for a Skeleton Army where each skeleton is weak, but they move and hit fast. The Skeleton Army can be easily countered with e.g. a Valkyrie, which, in turn, cannot beat P.E.K.K.A. The catch is that you can only have eight different cards in your deck, but dozens of different cards exist, so you need to be strategic and versatile.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of an x7 Elixir game that I played, it&rsquo;s quite a mayhem compared to the slower, traditional game modes, but I like it:</p>

			 <p>I feel rather cheated by Intel&hellip; I got a new desktop PC in 2020 with an i7-10700K CPU that uses the then-brand-new LGA1200 socket, thinking that as it was brand new, it would have a long and happy life ahead of it and I could safely just upgrade the CPU in the future.</p>
<p>Well, they used the socket for like two years only. Apparently the socket life spans have gone down dramatically from what they were earlier (like 20 years ago; see e.g. the LGA 775 socket), but Intel is especially bad in this respect, vs. AMD who has longer socket life spans. AMD released the AM4 socket in 2016 and the next socket, AM5, wasn&rsquo;t released until 2022.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel bad for Intel when the news broke the other day that their stock value is plummeting. My next PC won&rsquo;t feature an Intel CPU.</p>
